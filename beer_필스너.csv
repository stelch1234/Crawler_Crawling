reviews
"It is a decent beer , but it is slightly overrated , it has a bitter taste that remains in the aftertaste."
"biscuits, herbs, lemon grass, butter, golden, clear, white foam, medium bitterness, light body, lively, good beer"
"Tall, rocky white head.
Admittedly very weak nose, maybe some malt and some vanilla.
Taste more than makes up for it, having the crisp clean drinkability of a standard lager but with just enough nuance and finesse to keep me interested, particularly notes of citrus, cloves, and hay.
This is the beer to serve with a large plate of unidentified meat."
First time drink this beer and I think it reminds me more of fosters than any other pilsners ive had before. Not very good
Golden color with a spicy hop aroma.  Taste is crisp with a moderate spicy hop bitter finish.
"Probada varias veces, en botella y de barril. Color dorado claro con espuma blanca de baja retención. Aroma fresco  y levemente lupulado, cereales. En boca es fresca, gusto a cereales tostados, cierta astringencia, carbonatación media. Final fresco y levemente amargo que te hace beber mil litros."
"01.06.2015 -- pours clear golden colour with a big white head and some lacing. aroma grains, perfume. caramel malts up front, hoppy bitterness develops toward the finish. citrusy hops, fruits, smoke. quite bitter overall, which is a plus. nice!
06.12.2018 -- still nice but a bit sweetish and buttery, like so many czech pilsners.."
"Piana obfita, niezbyt trwała, pozostaje korzuszek na powierzchni, ładnie koronkuje. Barwa głębokie złoto. Klarowne.
Aromat dość ubogi, słód, DMS i bardzo delikatne masełko.
W smaku troszkę lepiej, jest słodowe bez wad, czuć szlachetny chmiel.
Goryczka umiarkowana, chwilę zostaje na języku, jest gładka, zachowuje odpowiedni balans.
Ogółem trochę lepsze niż taki zwykły eurolager."
"klasyk wsórd pilsów, pyszne piwo z zaostrzoną goryczą, dla każdego miłośnika piwa punkt ""must see"""
"0,5l can. Pours clear straw/golden with white head. Aroma of grass, floral, lemon, malty. Taste is initally malty and slightly sweet, but turns bitter with saaz hops. Grassy, lemon, really bitter. Finishes on saaz hops. The definitive pilsner."
"Česká ležáková klasika. Ideální sladovost i hořkost, jemná perlivost, příjemná vůně."
"Aroma: cracker, biscuit malt. grassy and little bit spicy hop aroma
Appearance: golden color with superb clarity and a 2-finger slightly off-white head which disappears soon.
Taste: follows the aroma. cracker, biscuit malt. grassy, some spicy, and slightly floral hop. bitterness is noticeable.…"

Pilsner is very hit and miss but this is the benchmark"
"Sehr gutes Pils (kommt ja auch von der Urquelle ;) wirklich immer gut, Flaschenkinder"
"Bottle.  Refined, subdued hoppy aroma and flavor.  Light yellow color.  Clean finish.  Simple, standard lager.  Very similar to Lvivskiy."
"Piwo złociste, klarowne.
Piana biała, dość wysoka.
Aromat słodowy, trochę chmielu, diacetylu.
W smaku słodowo, chmielowo z trawiastą goryczką."
"Bitter, hoppy pilsener. Malty and very fresh. Pretty crisp with soft grassy hops and grains. A solid Pils."
"Yardstick? Yes, of course... though Heinecken (for one) doesn't seem aware of it. ;-) And it's still a really nice beer, if you're a pilsener drinker. But these days, I'm more interested in variations on the original theme."
"Una de las mejores Pilsner industriales que puedas probar, si no la mejor. Notas malteadas y de hierba fresca, así como de lúpulos nobles clásicos. Buen amargor suave, perfecto equilibrio y enorme bebestibilidad."
",.. it has Compact White head, full bodied Taste, medium bitter, golden color, balanced hops And malt. good quality ingredients. one of the best big brands Pilsner beers."
"Perfect Pils, wat ook zeker te verwachten is gezien de historie van dit bier. Vol van smaak waarin de mout goed te proeven is. Goudgeel van kleur en een goede schuimkraag. -backlog de BierApp-"
"Pours a clear golden coloration with a large, foamy head and slightly visible carbonation. Smells of doughy, slightly grainy malt and grassy hops. Taste follows the nose, with a great balance of doughy, bready, just very slightly sweet malt and grassy hops, with a hint of citrus, grains and a light earthy/herbal note as well. Finishes with a light/medium bitterness and some grassy/herbal notes lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. Very good, for a lager, with a great balance of doughy, bready malt and grassy, herbal hops."
"Can, 4.4%. Clear golden, white head. Malt and Saaz aroma. Malty, bready flavour, sweetish with light hoppy bitterness. Slightly dry, crisp yet with a smooth maltyness. Nice."
"Capo di tutti capi of beers. Or lagers at least. You have to try it from tap of one of those pubs, where they serve it from large tanks and where they know exactly how to pour it. Bottled, canned or from a keg can't really tell the story"
"From bottle. Pours with modest medium bubble head that dissipated quickly. colour clear straw. Noble hop in aroma, not too promising. Body fine carbonation but a touch oily. Tastes of bready malt and pleasant czech hops with just a hint of bitterness. lingering subtle bitterness in the finish.
Good Bohemian beer."
Bottle. Pours golden with white head. Aroma of pale malts - little sweetness. Thin texture and body.
"From backlog. On draft at La Casa Argentina Prague. Light Golden with white head. Malts, hops and sweetness. Nice."

"2018-09-05, can, tag 10.11.18 (4 months old?), 8-4-7-3-16=38
The colour is dark blond. The aroma is wonderful, the expected malt depth, almost biscuity (zwieback), grassy hops, hint of smoke. Elegant malt base, very strong, an example for all new world Pilsners, the hopping is moderate, a bit herbaceous.
After drinking hundreds of craft Pilsners, this is still better.

"Ten pravy originalny Pierwszy Pilsner. Piana spora trwala, oblepia pokala, jasne z szumiacymi babelkami, moze zapach malo wyczuwalny, ale smak nagradza, zboza, lekka slodowosc i dominujaca harakterystyczna goryczka dla Pilsa z pilzna. ChOG zobowiazuje, pite wiele razy, zakupione w Czeskiej Republice, nigdy nie zawodzi zawsze jest takie samo. Najlepszy pils, jedno z najlepszych piw dolnej fermentacji oraz godne polecenia nawet mimo ze to z wielkiego globalnego browaru."
"Je suis amateur de pilsner depuis 25 ans et a mon gout cette bière représente le summum ... l'équilibre entre l'amertume florale, les arômes de céréales, et le nez légèrement moufette caractéristique d'une bonne pilsner !....la meilleur a mon gout !"

Decent. Nothing special. Like zagorka in czech style. A little bit stinky. Refreshing. Just lager.
Best pilsner Ive had so far. Pours clear golden with medium head. Sweet aroma and pleasant taste.
"Sempre ens quedarà per a sobreviure amb dignitat. Si no hi fos, s'hauria d'inventar...."
"Złote, klarowne, piana jest ładna i trzyma się przyzwoicie. Pachnie słodamk, obecne są nuty chmielu (lekko ziołowe). Czuć w smaku nuty chmielu, głównie jednak czujemy słód. Całkiem solidna goryczka. Bardzo pijalne, orzeźwiające. Klasyk wśród pilznerów - trzyma poziom i jest naprawdę niezłym piwem."
"Lo assaggiata in qualsiasi forma e luogo... Da plzen a Praga... Passando per i getränkemarkt della Germania fino ai pub italiani. La migliore pils di larga diffusione sul mercato. È una pils quindi amaro logico (lo dico per chi si lamenta del amaro). Schiuma consistente, al olfatto frutti di bosco. Al palato fresca e gradevole con un basso tasso alcolico. Top"
"Une excellente pils rafraîchissante en ces temps de fortes chaleurs. Un goût incomparable par rapport aux autres pils, c'est normal qu'elle soit conisdérée comme la mère des pils. Les tchèques savent s'y prendre pour brasser la pils. Les arômes de SAAZ et l'amertume du SAAZ vous donnent cette note incomparable. L'amertume est poussée bien loin, avec un IBU de 40 et la bière est peu alcoolisée, un must. Bravo à Urquell pour ce divin nectar."
"Skunks, tony masła w smaku i aromacie. Mokry karton i mokre zboże, goryczka niska."
"caramel, chocolate, toast, roasty, floral, amber, clear, frothy, white foam, medium sweetness, lightly bitter, full body, sticky, thick feel, lively,abrupt finish, long finish,"
"Bottle purchased with traveling in Europe, so from the source in Czech Republic. Pours clear gold with the smallest spritz of white head and lacing. Aroma: floral, honey, hops. Flavor: honey, biscuit, hops -- perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter. Mouthfeel: light-to medium-bodied, crisp and refreshing."
Izvorni pilsner koji kupis u Ceskoj ili Slovackoj je puno bolji od izvoznog koji se prodaje u Hrvatskoj...razlika je osjetna
"So many attempts to appreciate this... In fact, there is nothing light about this, except color.  Both sweetness and bitterness here seems to be heavy and really uneasy. Aftertaste follows you for a long-long time. It's definitely has it's own style, but...  Sorry fans, not my glass of beer."
"On tap at Pourhouse in Gastown. Served in a 10 oz glass. Little head on this pour. A nice amber color. Definitely not a super hopped beer, but decent bitter bite all the same. I’ve had many a glass over the years. Ironic that I haven’t gotten to writing a rating til now! It’s still the original pilsener. Nice!…"
"Złote, piana drobno i średniopęcherzykowa. W aromacie skórka od chleba, nuty ziołowe, diacetyl i lekki skunks. W smaku słodowo-cchmielowe, ziołowe, płytkie, ale lekkie. Goryczka w miarę wyraźna, ziołowo-łodygowa, ale nie zalega."
"On tap from tank in a Pilsner Urquell restaurant. 
I ordered ""Snyt"" and received it bright golden with tall white head.
Smells like s table of fresh scones with some orange marmalade lined up.
Mildly carbonated,  taste of bread , distinct and balanced bitterness in finish.

Perfectly fresh and authentic,
Will not be the same rating though from bottle back in Sweden."
"Pilsnerien Pilsneri, eli THE Pilsneri. Maista ihmeessä ja kokeile. Kevyt mutta maukas olemus. Toimii Prahan pubikierroksella eritätin hyvin."
"Стандартный чешский пилснер, все отлично, вкус, цвет, аромат. Единственный минус: завышенная цена в России."
"Fashionable 330ml can from 6 pack. Honey coloured, white head that disappears. Sweet aroma. Refreshing malty taste, not too fizzy, lovely bitter aftertaste. Great."
"June 2018. 330ml bottle, filtered, from BeerWulf as part of a World Cup Beers pack. The original pale lager. That gives it a certain edge. But it is an unimpressive drink. Slightly salty hops. This was the start of the death of interesting beer. Like the first white sliced loaf was the start of the death of bread. Sort of. [2.4]…"

"If you want a cheap beer that's available in any crappy supermarket, then you can't go wrong with Pilner Urquell. Nothing better than a hot summer day and couple cans in the freezer."
"Enjoyed many times, but well before RB inception. Decided to revisit and note by ordering a shaker full at Bulldog Ale House in Roselle, IL.. Displayed a clear, golden hue, with a presentable layer of soft white froth, and spots & streaks of lacing. The nose was soft, lightly sweet grain, with some grassiness & subtle spice. Medium bodied, with appropriate carbonation that escorted a pleasantly palate alerting, earthy & slightly minerally bitterness that lingered some. Crisp, and very food complementary."
"Not much in aroma, some herbs, touch of butter and malts. High carbonation and dry body. Malty taste with iron-ish bit (probably from hops, not tanks). Medium but long lasting herby bitterness. Quite nice beer, not great but definitely better than average Heineken or Carlsberg."
"Typeriktig tsjekkisk øl. En mer klassisk pils er det vanskelig å finne. 
En god øl overall. Noen som ikke liker aromaen til Saazhumlen. Kan skjønne det, men er ikke blant de. Synes dette er bedre enn de fleste norske pils du får kjøpt

"Botella de 330 ml, servida en tarro Pilsner Urquell. Color dorado intenso (oro viejo), brillante, cristalina, con carbonatación vivaz y una cremosa corona de espuma blanca de buena retención. Sus aromas son intensos a pan blanco con acentos florales y a especias. Su sabor, también bastante presencial, es a granos hornadas con un ligero toque de miel e intensas notas a flores y especies que dejan un agradable retrogusto en el paladar. Cuerpo ligero y buena carbonatación."
"Tank. Impressively dense white head on a light golden body. Flowery hops, a bit earthy, grains, light honey, cereals. Light sweetness, a hint of subtle mineralic touches, light bitterness. Smooth light body with soft carbonation. Very well balanced and not THE Pilsner by accident. Go back to Austrian industrial lager after this and cry."
"the aroma is malty and floral with hints of fresh grain, straw and some herbs... the taste is very clear and refreshening, malty and herbal, with notes of grain, hay and some grasses... bitter and dry aftertaste..."
"According to the history, the Czechs make beers since a while, but in the 1820s-30s they made ales (so top fetmented beers). After the 30s there was a small riot in Pilsen, because the people got fed up the various quality of the beers, and shattered many barrels. So the city of Pilsen decided to make bavarian-style beer. Joseph Groll bavarian master got invited to Pilsen and the brewery was born in 1839. Around the 1870s almost every brewery produced lagers. So this lager is bottom fermented, and it has a very strong, aromatic lager taste. Anyway, i think there are tiny differences in…"
"Wyczuwalna goryczka. aromat spoko, typowo lagerowy. nie czuć alkoholu. jest dobrze."
"Das Pilsner Urquell ist wohl die beste Alternative zu allen Massenbieren. Fast überall erhältlich, Qualität gleich bleibend gut. Trinkt sich unkompliziert, süffig. Wenns nichts anderes gibt, ein Urquell geht immer."
"t I expect exactly that from a classic Pilsner, The Father of all pilsners , really hoppy"
"Na upał idealne piwo. Zbożowe z konkretną gorączką. Co z tego że lekki skunks czy diacetyl w aromacie. Tak ma być, a i tak jest fajnie."
"I had it from the can. The taste is cereal, grass, and slight bitterness. It's slightly sweet with a lingering bitterness. It's got a somewhat prickly carbonation. It's simple yet solid."
Cette bière est plutôt bonne  mais je regrette qu'elle soit si sucrée! Dommage.
"From tap @Staromestska (Pilsner Urquell Original Restaurant), Prague, Czechia. Golden clear with massive white dense head, nice lacing. Aroma of berries, malts, grain, bit of citrus. Bitter taste, long bitter finish, average carbonation. Having a popular beer in a central tourist destination? Why not? Bitter, refreshing, very nice."
Marketing strongly supported beer with under average quality. There are many much better beers in Czech republic.
"Bottle. Clear gold, thick and generally stable but not very pretty, white head, some lacing. Aroma malty, biscuits, grassy, hoppy. Taste smooth, not very sweet. Carbonation medium to high, tingling. Bitterness medium to high, grassy, hoppy. Aftertaste malty, hoppy, bready, grassy. Good."
"Bottle of 33cl, in a pils glass; from the fridge.

So, the first and only pils... Is a pils. A good one (the taste stays in the mouth, but not too long) but not the best. Enjoyable, refreshing.…"
"Nagy klasszikus... Azt hiszem nem kell különösen megmagyarázni miért... Szerencsére most (is) a megszokott minőség, az import is. Stílus és kategória alkotó... Egy ismerőst idézve: ""se több, se kevesebb"" :)"
"Botella 33cl. Esta Pilsner no defrauda en lo absoluto. Equilibrio genial, lupulado y cuerpo medio-ligero. Color dorado y espuma no muy intensa. Sabor a cereal, semitostado, pobre.
Presenta un buen regusto a lupulado que se hace bien de notar si bien estamos hablando de una Lager."
"33cl bottle at home, bought at Slijterij Groningen, Vismarkt. Appearance: clear golden with medium white head. Aroma: light malts, grains, some grass and hay. Taste: medium sweetness and medium bitterness. Notes of malts, grains, some hoppy bitterness. Palate: light bodied, slick texture and medium to lively carbonation. Good pilsener."
"Had this from tap a couple of times in Prague. Pours clear golden with a foamy, lasting, small, white head. The aroma contains malt, grass, hops and grain. It tastes medium sweet and light, grainy ’German-like’ bitter. Long, dry, grainy finish, nowhere wry. Medium body, slick/oily texture, fizzy carbonation. A very good Pilsner. (Edited 5/6/17)"
"Golden color with low white head. Aroma is fresh, noble hops, clean cereals and bread. All cereal in mouth, little roasted, fairly high bitterness. Fresh, light and a classic!"
"One of better beer from those most popular concerns. Refreshing, drinkable."
"Una buona pils, perfettamente aderente allo stile: leggera, fresca, carbonazione non eccessiva e luppolatura come previsto dallo stile."
"0.5 l can, best before September 2018. Clear, golden with a medium large, frothy, stable, white head. Slightly sweetish, slightly grassy-spicy aroma of grains, some straw and traces of citrus. Slightly sweet, moderately bitter, quite grassy-spicy and minimally buttery taste of grains, straw, traces of citrus and a touch of vanilla, followed by a short, moderately bitter, quite grassy-spicy finish. Medium body, smooth and slightly effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Way better when fresher, lots of crispy Lager goodness, still a nice brew.…"
"Barwa ciemnosłomkowa, piana z dużymi pęcherzykami, szybko opada bez lacingu. W smaku lekka goryczka i słodkość w finiszu. Bez specjalnych aromatów, bez wielkich doznań ale piwo jak na popularny lager całkiem niezłe."

"Label stamped: MAY1418 08:03. So, I assume it was bottled in May of 2017. Not exactly fresh. Georgeous bright gold color with a nice white bubbly head and bubble rising through the gold. Aroma is grainy, bready, spice. Taste is bready, lemon, a touch of sweet malts. Mouth feel is not thin; there is a substantialness there. The hops begin to assert a bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. The bitter aftertaste lingers quite awhile."
"Nice golden yellow with white head that left quickly. Not much aroma. Good mouth feel, good body. Mild hop flavor. Really balanced. I like it. The body is what gets me as special. Plus the clean taste. Had this on tap at Jasper's in San Francisco. Listed as 5 percent. As the glass warmed I got a malty almost nutty flavor. Maybe a corn flavor. Very nice.

"33 cl bottle bought from supermarket. Pours clear golden color with medium white head. Aroma of hops, grains, malt. Taste is similar to aroma: malty, grainy, floral hops. Light body, medium carbonation, overall a good pilsner beer."
"Bottle. Clear gold with a fluffy white head. Aroma of flowery hops, grains and a little hint of diacetyl. Taste is malty, grainy with spicy and floral hops. Mild bitterness. Medium carbonation. Smooth and soft mouthfeel. Balanced, clean and refreshing. Easy drinking. Ok."
"Bottle from supermarket in Monza, though obviously I've tried it many times before. Nice to come back to every once in a while. The taste of corn was more pronounced than I recall, but the thin mouthfeel, slight malt, then big bitterness are always there. It is what it is. And its decent."
"Pretty much what I expected from a pilsner. Good beer, worth trying. Personally, I liked the taste and the palate was a bit more intricate than a usual with a pilsner. Worth the try."
Rerate. Draught at Darryll's Greensboro NC. Light floral aroma with quick sharp hop bite. Bitterness does not linger long after swallow. Light and refreshing. Medium bodied. Very nutty malt character. Balanced.
"I always pass this on the beer isle and think: “Pilsner? MEH”.

"Re-rating after hundreds more occasions. Big grassy bitterness laced with an edge of sugary malt and buttery whiffs of diacetyl, and that slick richness.  Lots of character but demands no special attention. Old rating, 2008: A classic. Sampled many times from bottle and draught. Nice to find it in the odd place here and there in Brussels, to get a break from the ales. Refreshing, zippy, bitter, especially when fresh on tap. Can be savored or quaffed. Great with a burger. Reliable."
My favourite pilsner. Always packing a few of it in my fridge. Can't remember how many times I bothered my uncle to pack me a 50 cans when he traveled to CZ. Now cans are imported in my country but I'm still waiting for those stylish glass bottles... make it happen

Cerveza parecida a las comerciales pero hecha con cariño. Mucho lúpulo en gusto claramente amargo
"A little surprised I haven't rated this somewhere during my journey. 
 Pours a thin golden with a thin white head. The aroma is faint. All I really get is bread and some slight floral hops. Moderate bitterness here. But flavors remain weaker but they aren't bad. Heavier in floral elements and with bread and lemon. Floral aftertaste. Its light to medium in body and thin in texture. This is a beer that would be amazing if I was a freshman in college, which means its not very good."
"Wersja butelkowa nie jest tak dobra jak wersja beczkowa w szczegolnosci w Pradze w wersji niefiltrowanej. Wersja recenzowana jest oryginalnie zakupiona w Czechach (nie „sprowadzana” przez KP). W aromacie chmiel i drozdze; ciut diacetylu niestety. W smaku slody i przebijajacy sie chmiel. W posmaku lekko ten diacetyl. Ogolnie super pilsner ale kegowa wersja rozklada go bezapelacyjnie. 
Update. W jednej butelce jest diacetyl w innej mniej lub wcale."

As fine as they get... Fabulous hos aroma and fine bitter flavor balanced against a gentle but light maltiness. Excellent.
"Beer with a gold colour and white creamy head. Aroma is full of malts and herbal hops (ŽPČ). Not bad beer, but requires great bartender´s care and storage of course."
"Easily the best at todays rained out bbq with friends. Gold pour, big head, grassy, grainy and slightly bitter. Lighter body, very easy drinking.  Drank the next 3 cold straight from the can."
"I haven't had this in years. Just got a collector's four pack of pint cans in a lunch box! Pours in the classic Pils style - golden hue and a nice, white head pillow that dissipated. I poured it into an Eagles Pilsner glass (the eve of the NFC Championship Game v the Queens). The nose is sweet like honey and malt. The palate is smooth and honey tongued. Great flavor of honey, malt, and Pilsner hop bite. Would love to have this with pizza or a BBQ in the summer. Perfect at 4.4%. Cheers!"
"Brilliantly clear, pale colour, balanced but with a crisp bitterness, moderate to high carbonation, slight happy aroma showcasing classic noble hops, clean yeast profile and overall a delicious beer. Exactly what a Pilsner should be and why 90% of the world's beer is based on this brew."

"Not being a big lager guy, I was expecting to be underwhelmed. I wasn't. Great pilsner aroma of grain, some grass and as mentioned below, green beans. Taste is a better version of so many macro imitators. Grain, hay, honey, pepper, nice bitterness, slightly metallic at the end."
"Bottle pour into shaker pint glass from Andover Liquors. Appearance is clear gold with beautiful sparkle, 1/2-finger width fizzy white head with fair retention and trace lacing. Aroma is crackery, vaguely metallic pilsner malts, saaz hops. Taste is as aroma with metallic flavor overriding the cracker aspect, late bitter. Palate is light bodied with slick, thin texture, soft carbonation and dry finish as taste. Overall, the pilsner standard. 'nuff said."

"500ml can from the shop, drunk at home. Pours clear with a thick but short-lived frothy head, medium lacing but no bead. Aroma of bread, cereal and slightly floral hops. Creamy at first in the mouth with some fruit and cereal flavours. Medium bodied, with more than a touch of sweetness, and a strong bitter finish that becomes a slightly astringent aftertaste. Overall, less to my liking than Budweiser, but a very good pilsener nevertheless."
"Gold colour with medium white head. Sweet bready malt, successful combination of spiciness and sweetness. The first of its kind that I've tried. Good one."
"It pours clear yellow body with visible carbonation. Head is medium sized and white. Retention is average, no lacing. Smells mildly of sweet malts, slight herbal hops and corn. Taste is well balanced between sweet malts and bittering hops. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated. Crisp, dry and hoppy finish. Very good lager."
More hoppy and lighter color than its Czech rival Budweiser but an easy drinking Pilsner non the less
"On tap U Salzmann?, Pilsen, Czech Republic. Unpasteurized. Clear golden with strong creamy white head. Malty and flowery, pleasant aroma of raw malt and honey. Sweet, herbal with flower notes from ?atec hops. Malty finish. Very tasty. A true classic!"
Bottle from Morrisons. I'm no great expert with the Pilsner style. I really enjoyed this beer. Lovely hoppy aroma sweet Pilsner malt and appropriate bitterness. Gave the impression of a well balanced lager and I haven't enjoy that one so much since sitting in the very hot sun.
"On bottle. Pours golden with thick head, which dissapears quickly. Notes of fruits and citra - easy drinkable. Light hops - reminds of a Tuborg, with more co2."

So this is the original pilsner. It's a good beer indeed, and maybe it's good it didn't change, but honestly there are better followers out there."

"Clear golden coloured beer with a huge, white, mostly good lasting head. Aromas of malt, grain, grassy tart hops. Taste is light hoppy bitter and malty with lasting light bitterness in finish but overall quite thin. Light body, creamy texture, average carbonation. Hmm, not bad for a macro."
overrated. not as good as in the past. quite similar to zlaty bazant. better in pub where they know how to serve it.
"Aroma of grass and malts. Taste is grass and herbs, faint spice with bread-like malts. Strong but balanced finish. Beautiful, creamy mouth-feel. Great beer!"
"It’s a good attractive pilsner. Very smooth, not too gassy, a little yeasty, but good."
Slightly bitter. Strong aroma (skunky) but pleasant. Consistent head and lacing. It's widespread and cheap so it makes it a perfect beer for nights with buddies. Recommend!
"Pours light, with limited head. Has the aroma of slight hoppiness with a hint of grass. Taste well reflects the aroma, though it has a smoothness that limits the hop profile. Aftertaste is minimal with a slight hint of clover. Told by a friend that this was a ""must try"" beer. Not sure I'd agree."

"This is the lager that all other lagers should be measured by. 
Citrusy, fresh sweetness with a touch of bitterness and skunkiness describe this staple beer.
Might be just a touch too bitter for my taste but this is a beer that I keep returning to."
"I would say - that is an example of the style (Czech Pilsener) and every should try this one. Amber crystal colour, nice lasting foam. Malty aroma, a beat sweet in taste, and nevertheless is a combination of spicy and sweetness. Short bitter but pleasant aftertaste. Drinkable."
"500ml bottle. Pours a pale orange gold with a thin white head. Aroma: Grass, mild citrus, sweet malt notes. Taste: Sweet malt, mild citrus and earthy flavours. Thin bodied. Moderate carbonation.

The father of Czech beer. Still so good although massivelly produced. But I am from Pilsen so my rating goes from heart.

"Just realised that i haven't rated this classic brew, so I must do it right away... Pours clear golden with a large slightly off-white head. Aroma has sweetish maltiness and a hint of herbal notes too. Taste is rather similar; malty caramel and fruit flavour, combined with moderate crispy hops. Smooth mouthfeel. Average carbonation. Tasty and well-balanced brew."
"Well, the original one, the first i used to drink, the reference to judge the others."
Very good beer good pilsner hoops taste and good beer aroma. My best beer original pilsner.
"I like the hoppy aroma! Much less body and aftertaste than my favorite style, IPA.

Rerate: Excellent aroma and mild grainy taste. At 4.4% ABV much more ""sessionable"" than most session IPAs."
"It is a fresh pilsener with a good hit of hop and a nice dry, bitter finish."
Bbd  05.02.18 bought in Cyprus. Crisp clean Amber colour. Very little on the nose and the head doesn't last very long. Minimal hop flavour with more malt drive which hangs on the back. Classic Pilsner style which is very drinkable in the heat.
Can brought by Joseph from Czech. Great nose of light malt. Great head of foam. Nice light malty taste- this is the great original.
A good pilsner speaks for itself – lovely colour and taste. That it! Drink it and enjoy.
"definitivamente a melhor pilsner do mundo. de um dourado espetacular, combinado o dulçor com lúpulo saaz."
"The first and still one of the best Pils available as to my Gusto. More hoppy than Budweiser, yet not as bitter and monotonous as other common Pilsner."
"Pretty standard pils, grassy notes, herbal and spicy hops, bitter aftertaste. Bit of a Heineken/Euro lager off flavor makes it not as good as it could be. This may be the original, but pilsners can be done far better."
"Perhaps the gold standard of Czech pilsners? With stiff competition from Staropramen, I'd say, even though they are quite different in taste, as far as lagers go. Has a robust quality for such a pale lager, and the head, if poured correctly on draught, will have the mouthwatering consistency of cream. Bottled, here in the UK at least, it is still a massively enjoyable beer."
"Nice head it’s fizzy but small bubbles that add a decent texture. Dry hops.come through with a touch of softness. Not a huge amount of sweetness coming.from the malts. It’s really rather good. Embarrasses the competition with other simler priced high end marco lagers (bitburger, budvar etc). I would love to try it on tap where the hops should reveal more of its.fruity aroma"
Bottle from Asda. Looks clear gold with an off-white head and heaps of bubble streams shooting up the glass. The nose has a dry herb coupled with a light citrusy tone. A sweet malt and dusty grain is also there. The flavours match the nose with a light refreshing balance of sweet and herby. It’s medium light with a sharp moderate light sparkle which equals super refreshing. The mild flavours beautifully balanced with the sharp refreshing body make for a smashing Pilsner.

"From the bottle. Bought a 6-pack while q.b. is away. Good looking beer. Aggressive pour will result in a fine and lasting head. Clean and crisp aroma of light sweet malts and hop flowers, with a full malt body and a strong clean bitterness, malt and hoppy finish. I’m not complaining about this."
"Pilsner Urquell pours a clear, deep golden color and sports an average white head. The hops in the nose are noble, earthy, herbal, floral, and down to earth and harmonize well with the bready malts. The same bready malts carry over to the attack and unfold muted sweetness as well as faint creaminess, which are quickly balanced out by snappy bitterness from the hops on the mid-palate before the bone-dry finish. Very nice and clean in its simplicity."

"Bottle. Pours clear golden with average, mostly diminishing white head. Aroma is malty, grain, hay, with some herbs and unfortunately significant skunk. Taste is light malty, grainy sweet and medium herbal bitter, more pleasant than aroma. Bitterness is short and clean. Medium body, average carbonation, rather thin texture. Not bad, refreshing pils, but green bottle version should be avoided - better try it from tap or can."

Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Seems to be about five months old from looking at the best before date, which is too bad. Have had this in way better condition before."

Taste is very much akin to the aroma, much more hop flavor than the average lager with the familiar taste of malted barley. Flavor is a lot stronger than I was expecting with some citric undertones. Definitely the best lager on the market. Recommended."

One finger head that lasts most of the glass. Light body dark yellow. Easy on mouthfeel some delicate sweet malts balances with lingering bitterness. Tastes much better than it’s 4.4 abv. The best non premium pils and the original pilsner is still top drawer. Got a cupboard full of these!

Mouthfeel is light body, light crisp carbonation, grainy earthy hop aftertaste. Overall, it’s about as expected, but I imagine I can drink better for the style."

Taste has a slightly crisp/crackery malts base, slight citrus, notes of grass and maybe some floral hops hints. Medium to low sweetness and medium bitterness, finishes dry and slightly on the bitter side. Light bodied with low to medium carbonation, just enough to bring a touch of pleasant crispness. Overall not remarkable, though undoubtedly well made."

"Clear golden colour , good white head , kinda sweet aroma, nice bitterness and malty taste."

Largely mass produced for popularity. Still better than standard light lagers by a mile. Slight hop aroma and bitterness make it decent. Drank in Munich pub.

250117. Bottle from Dan Murphy’s. I first rated this back in December 2008. Retracting as part of my 50 beer challenges for 2017 (re-rate 10 of my first 100 beers rated). Much more full bodied than I recall with a bold golden amber colour and a sturdy white head. Very grainy aroma but that is what you want in a classic Pilsner. Not as thin in the mouth as I remember it to be either. Long dry aftertaste. I couldn’t drink a lot of this but I could drink a few I reckon. I can now see why it is regarded as a classic.
"Pours clear golden with a unevenly pored medium to big sized almost long lasting white head. 
Typical smell of green and hay hops. First sweet malts then an overtaking above average bitterness with a long dry finish. Not complex but therfore straight forward, almost full bodied and refreshing. I like this beer in combination with some polish Sausages and crispbread."
"Bottle. Clear, beautiful dark golden color, white head. Caramel, malty aroma, hints of fruits. Dry taste, medium, maybe high bitterness. Bready malty aftertaste, astringent. Fresh carbonation, silky mouthfeel."

Very light smell- hints of wheat. Light golden color. Slight hop in the taste. Finish is slightly hoppy. Easy to drink.
"Bottle. Nose is wheat, citrus. Palate is tart, bread, some citrus, wheat. Medium carbonation. pretty good, had this in Prague last summer on tap, which was better (maybe 3.5-6), but i need to taste it again."
"Draft. Firm white head, dark yellow colour, unique bitter taste, light and smooth on drinking, always an adequate choice."
"tap in leeds, from a fresh cask(eg tapped yesterday). I was suprised by the low ratings below so felt compelled to add my own.Nice head on tap -bit more than the bottle.Full buttery malt flavour dominates,finished by crisp hop bite , very pleasant. Not as hoppy as some german pils, but still lovely very moreish."
"From a bottle. I don’t really like pilsners. This was just kind of there. Not offensive, but no aroma or taste to speak of."
"skunky and smoky, medium carb, kinda nice sort of butteryish mouth feel, I haven’t had many pilsners but it’s definitely better than summit."
05.12.2016 - Clear pour. Strange lager fermented metallic aroma and taste. Extreme thin dull malt body. No nice hop aromas
A classic. Nice can too :) stampa 1842. Well done. For what it’s trying to be it’s perfecto. Nice and heap in Czech too. Enjoy
"Keg at Miller & Carter, Reading. Pale gold with a large white head and a thin, slightly prickly fizz. Grassy flavour, tending towards minerality. Bitter compared to other well-known lagers, although still not that bitter. Dryish, crisp and clean- I can see why some people like it; it does have a certain elegance, but for me personally I found the flavour a little unpleasant."
"500ml bottle. Pours a golden amber with a small white head. Nicely carbonated. Nose is malty, grainy, bit of lemon and straw. Full of flavour with a nice hop kick in the after taste. Fantastic stuff, so refreshing and drinkable."
"Pours a sprightly golden with an acceptable head. Fairly rich malty aroma which carries through on to the taste. Good body, not watery. Overall not bad at all."
"Bottle. Pours clear golden with a medium head. Aroma is grassy and buttery, quite dirty. Body is light to medium with a lively and carbonation. Short palate. Good drinkability, well done, yet not super exciting."
"Pours a pale gold with a thin white head. Aroma is malt and floral. Taste is the same, super maltyand crisp with cereal notes and a light floral hoppiness. This is probably the purest malt flavour I have ever tasted in a beer. Easy drinking and smooth. If this is the original pilsener, why does every other one I have had taste like skunky feet?"
The first pilsner in the world as it should be. An ethalonique one. Good mass beer beer with a pleasant bitterness. Recomeded with czech pork dishes.
Review written before I made ratebeer account. Solid Czech beer with a nice bitterness.

"Clear golden yellow beer with white head. Aroma of bread, cereal and corn. Nice subtle aroma. Light sweetness up front and a good amount of lingering bitterness. Perfect balance and the classic pilsner taste. Good medium body and carbonation. For me this is the best of its kind and my go to beer when in need of a pilsner."
"Aroma: Feet and dirt ; Appearance: pale golden, clear, minimal head ; lightly bitter, lightly sour ; light body, thin feel, average carbonation, short finish. Overall a mediocre beer, with absolutely no distinguishing traits, and a feet aftertaste (and smell)."
"330ml bottle at Purecraft Bar, Birmingham. clear pale gold with a very thin white head of disparate bubbles. Aroma of bread, biscuit, leather, and faint Red Leicester. Flavours of grain and faint cheddar. Not bad."
500 ml bottle. Pours golden with a white head. The aroma is grassy with some grainy malt. Light to medium watery body with a lively carbonation. The taste starts with an initial light sweetness and has a medium persisting bitterness. Flavor of grains and fruits. Clean and crisp but a little one-dimensional.
"Tried it in Poland, finally got to see it in NYC. Not my #1, but it’s a very pleasant beer, overall."
"From 500ml can. Pours a clear golden color with a medium white head. Big bubbles in carbonation. Hay nose, grass, a bit of caramel, base malt. Taste is malty sweet at start but not too much and then you get such a nice crisp dry finish. So well balanced."

"Clear golden with moderate yellow tinted head and visible bubbles. Lager yeast, herbs and some base malt. Hoppy with a good dose of malt. Smooth, light palate. Somewhat watery but not too much so. An excellent pilsner."
"Pretty basic Pilsner, what a Pilsner should taste like. Light and refreshing."
Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is a clear orange color with a medium sized white head. The aroma is grain and slight hops. The taste is follows the nose but is extremely well balanced. An excellent Pilsner.
"Bottle, poured into a stange (fancy!). This is a really good lager. It’s crisp and light, but there’s a lot of floral hop aroma and a noticeable lager yeast bite that keeps it from getting bland or boring. It’s still a lager, so it’s not exactly bursting with flavor, but this is mighty tasty swill."
Malts with some hoppy notes in aroma. Pours golden with white head. Taste is medium dry with malts and herbs. Low to medium bitterness at the finish. Overall ok.

"Bright dark straw color with moderate activity. Foamy white 3 finger head, lasting around 5-10 minutes, offering a decent amount of lacing. Flavors of sweet grains, faint caramel and lemon, saaz and noble hops. Low perception of sweetness, but highly sharp with a pleasant bitterness. Slick and smooth medium to full body with prickly carbonation. Light and short finish, lingering grainy notes and some grassy noble hops. Overall good quality craft.

"50 cl bottle from a local supermarket (around € 2). BB 02.04.2017. Pours clear, bright light golden with a small but persistent near white head. Aroma’s that of damp cornflakes and fakeish grassy hoppiness. Tastes clean, cerealy, grassy. A rather bitter finish. Creamy soft mouthfeel with crisp carbonation. So when did they decide they’ll do it with ’hop products’ instead of hops? Is that a direct result of SABMiller takeover? Overall it ain’t bad though - I prefer this to almost any widely available lager, and often choose this at Pudel for example, when in good company and it doesn’t matter what…"

"Bottle. Looks like classic pilsner, clear, golden with big fluffy white head. Aroma of malt and touch of herbal hops. In taste lightly sweet, malty with herbal hops. Light body, high carbonation, medium to low bitterness. Classic."
"Clear, deep gold. Aroma is clean malt sweetness but also a mineral roundness. Taste is malty and spicy with bitter hoppy character. The spice has a nice quality to it. Very nice pils with right amount of bitterness."
"Bottle. Nice concept, very good notion of balancing a decent flavour with the more drinkable qualities of most pilsners. However, there is a difference between acknowledging this and considering the best exponent of a style. While the flavour is complex, it could have been a bit more long lasting. It obviously is one of the better macrobrewed ones, of course. Aromas are nice but somewhat sparse, mostly cereal-ish. Good choice for a pilsner, but there is no point to mindlessly rave about it being perfect, because of the lack of complexity in the aromas and the slightly thin texture.…"
Draft - Light sweet bready grains. Clear gold with a nice white head. Some citrus and grainy notes with a very dry finish. Touch of bitterness in the finish.
"Aroma - grassy, grainy, simple and pleasant. Appearance is clear, golden straw, nice pillowy head, good lacing. Taste is crisp, grainy, and lightly bitter; grassy hops, bready malts, consistent throughout the palate; nicely quenching. A very simple beer that delivers the goods."
"Out of the can poured a deep gold, crystal clear, with a thin white persistent head. Medium-high bready malt character (reminiscent of baked pretzel), caramel, moderate level of spicy (saaz) hops, grassy, some subtle lemon notes along with (not unpleasant) buttered popcorn as it warmed. Balance tilting more towards malt on the palate. Crisp, clean, refreshing. A true classic."

"A very cool pilsner, I enjoyed this one on tap at the White Whale bar in Prague, during a trip around the city by a hot afternoon. Very pleasing and refreshing, taste doesn?t change much from other pilsners available in czech republic but this one is somewhat more spicy than the others. Cool hops aftertaste, a good bet. Best served cold on tap! Really looking forward to taste the unfiltered one next time... APPROVED BY TAVERNY?S BLACK METAL CREW!"
Tap. Pours light yellow/gold. Aroma is mild malt and grass. Clean crisp taste with some mild bitterness. Good for the style.
"The original, well executed without too much fanciness. Fitting as the meter to compare all other Pilseners to, and most would fall short in my opinion."
"Clear, golden, after few seconds head dissapears competly, high carbonation. Very weak aroma: bread, hay. Light to medium body, medium sweetness. Clean, bit empty flavour, some bitterness at fionish (medium level). Comparing to ""eurolagers"", bitterness is quite high, bot overall it’s empty and dissapointing."

Nonetheless it’s easy to drink, refreshing, watery, fizzy and short-lived, so, all in all your average pils with that extra sweaty tinge."

"Tasted from an imported bottle. Litterally the archetypical Pilsener, and as such ’responsible’ for not only the great Czech and German Pilseners but also the vast ocean of bland standard lagers derived from it... An ’urtyp’ with cream white head and deep golden colour, dry and grainy maltiness, relatively light, but primarily hoppy, with a grassy and floral character, long and bitterish. In all a good Bohemian Pilsener but I had better examples; nevertheless a good introduction to the style, though I suspect this tastes a lot better from tap in Plzen, where it originated."
"Bottle at home. Clear straw yellow with a thin white head. Notes of pilsner malts, bitter generic hops, interesting unripe red fruit - like raspberries and strawberries - followed by a malt sweetness that drags it down a bit. Light bodied, high carbonation, refreshing finish."

There are many awesome tasty beers out there, but Pilsner Urquell always sits well with you. You drink 10 pints one day, and can still drink more the day after. without being forced. Nejlepsí pivo na svete."
"On tap in prague. Clear golden with medium creamy white head. Aroma is a little buttery, grassy hops, typical helles stuff. Taste is well balanced everything. Hoppy and nice. In the finish the butter kicks in again. Medium body. Smooth mouthfeel. Ok I guess."
"Deep gold color with strong large white foam. Aromas of European hops, light coloured soft malts, grass, herbs and notes of light sweet honey. Palate, full body with smooth thicker texture leaving sweet but dry and crisp hoppy finish. Taste is sweet with developing hoppy bitterness, reminds of soft hop tea, fresh grass, dandelions with light touch of honey at the back. Overall, quite nice as a lager type not watery, sweet grassy/ herbal taste with nice finish. Good one, do recomend."

"0,5l bottle. I bought it in Hungary. The label says made in Czech Republic. Clear golden colour, little head that slowly disappears. Arome is quite nice. Sweet malts, little citrus. Taste little sweet malts but suddenly medium bitter hoppiness comes in. Light/medium body, medium carbonation. The finish is long bitterness. It’s a classic bear but I’m sure that if I’d drink in Plzeň it would be better. UPDATE: I had one on tap in the Czech Republic and it was way better. More herbs in the aroma. Hoppier with a yeasty creamy texture. The rating is for this version."
"Pilsner Urquell: a Pilsner from the Czech Republic, the first of it’s kind. Minimal head but pours smoothly when done properly. Aroma of sweet but light malt and very strong nose. Probably the best beer to drink in big mouthfuls as the flavors really sweeps out of the beer. Some may say it’s very similar to a Bud or Miller Light. It does have a very similar taste but is far superior. Great beer if you would want to play Beer Pong and show your great beer knowledge and taste to your friends. As a beer it definitely pairs well with Lays Salt & Vinegar potato chips because it almost has that sour taste of…"

"Can, 50cl. Golden clear with a frothy white head. Beautiful beer. Malty aroma, but for some reason I find it hard to find any hops. Nice bitterness and a fantastic mouthfeel. A light body with a lively neat carbonation. This beer makes my mouth dry ever so slightly with the lingering bitterness. Though my experience with lagers is limited, I’m very happy about this beer."
"Clear golden beer, standar White head, normal carbonation, the aroma is not that good, metallic notes, some earthy notes and some dough notes are perceived. When is tasted it has a medium body with the expected flavor for a Pilsner, bitter and dense in palate. The aftertaste is as well bitter a little bit sour, and persistent."
"Very good beer. But sometimes to much toffee and butter. An sometimes to bitter, and sometimes to sweet. Sometimes this beer makes me feel very good. Sometimes it makes me feel strange. But this is not a bad beer. It is something special about it. Try it you will love it."
"Tap at tabacka. Clear golden colour with huge head off. Aroma of malts, bread. Taste almost the same with grain, full body,bitter aftertaste."
"Some hop in aroma, grassy, malt. Same in taste. 

Chmielowe, trawiasty aromat uzupe?niony diacetylem i mokra sciera. Ma to swój urok. W smaku podobie. Dobrze pijalny pils."
"Drunk countless times, this time from can. Noticeable aroma of grassy hop, malt, light hay. Has an oily feel, tingly peppery middle carrying a light citrus with the grassy notes and earthy malt flavour. Great feel on a warm day, crisp and dry, lingering doughy notes. Harkens back to lager sessions of my youth, in a great way. A light refreshing Pilsner."
"11.2-ounce bottles. It has a sort of skunky aroma, but it has a rich flavor that has little bitterness. I tend to prefer drinks that have a little more abv but this excellent beer has gotten me to try out more pilsners."
"Very yeasty aroma like dough. Pours golden with a thin, white head. Nicely balanced bitter and sweet flavours. Light bodied, thin and a bit lively. The best mainstream beer."
"Rich malt aroma with hop

Thick orangish yellow

Very rich hop flavour in the finish

Thick bitterness…"
"Translucent gold, puffy white head, medium-light body, medium-high carbonation.



Aroma: noble hops, sweet fresh pilsner malt, faint skunk, lots of decoction or kettle…"
The pilsner by which all others are judged. The OG of the Pilsner world as it were. Purposefully skunky in aroma the hops jump right out at you. The mouthfeel is divine. It dangles at the edges of your palate tempting you to drink more.
"Clear golden, not very lasting medium sized white head. Aroma of malts and cereal. Rich malty taste with some bitterness. Medium carbonation. Good pilsner."
"Bottle at home quick super market grab, sometimes the beers I haven’t rated surprise me. Dusty orange pour small head. Nose is hoppy and malts. Tastes of bitter hops, grassy, honey, some malts. Bitter and decent flavors. Nice carbonation."
"grass, citrus, caramel, golden, clear, minimal head, white foam, light sweetness, lightly bitter, light body, thin feel, average carbonation, bitter
Refreshing, and dry finish - nice."
"On tap. Parallel tested with kozel premium. Clear golden color with medium white head. No lacing. Aroma is some kind of grassy, metallic and grainy, not so impressive. Missing Czech hop character of some dusty and earthy notes. Flavor is also metallic and grainy. Maybe it has fuller body than kozel but still I think kozel is better ecample of czech beer and pilsner urquell is more like german pilsner. Ok, but it could be much better."
"Pours golden with medium top. Aroma is malty, some hay and grass. Taste is quite same, additionally some metal and burnt malts. Nice pilsner!"
33 cl bottle from Consum supermarket in Costa Blanca Spain. Pours clear golden with a fine white head. Aromas of hops and fresh cut grass. Taste is bitter. Good pilsner.
"Keg at The Roebuck, Leek (Titanic) A clear golden colour with a fizzy white head. Aroma of grain, slight cereal malt, some honey and spicy, grassy hops. Taste is similar of grain, cereal, some honey, maybe some bread, grass and subtle peppery hops. Medium bodied and moderate carbonation. A dry, crisp, grassy hop bitterness in the finish. A great pilsner as expected, decent body, probably one of the best I’ve had. For a lager its very crisp and light."
"One of my favorite pilsners, plenty of grassy hops, honey with a nice carbonation bite. Clear golden body with a nice fizzy cap."
Насыщенный золотой цвет. Отличный вкус и аромат. Классика в своём сегменте.

Taste: oak, plankwood, lake water
Body: light
Ibu: low, -10

"On tap, Budejovicky dvor. Clear golden color with huge creamy head. Aroma is malty, light hoppy, floral with notes of spice. Taste is malty, medium sweet, hoppy, bitter aftertaste"
"Light gold with lots of carbonation. Light malts with lime tang. Crisp all the way through. It's a classic for a reason.

"A- soft bready malts, light caramel, hint of earthy hops

Ap- nice golden color, white head fades, 

Flavor- soft and sweet malts up front and last through out. Sweet dissipates and is replaced by hops.…"
"Honey and biscuit aroma, clear gold colour with a strong head. Nice hops with a hint of lime rind and prominent bitterness. Not much else to it, but the balance is fucking perfect. Bravo etc."
Definitely the best pilsner Ive ever had. Very soft taste and the hop balance is perfect. My favorite czech beer.
"clean bread/cereal malt aroma with almost no detectable hops; light white head, clear pale-golden; light-medium sweetness, very lightly bitter; light-medium body, creamy, soft carbonation, long easy finish that’s only delicately bitter. Enjoyed after a pizza for lunch which helped cleanse my palate; would gladly pair with pizza or a burger."
"fantastic pilsner...simple as that. Very drinkable, very much a summer drinker"
"Cereal, pale, minimal white head, medium carbonation, light body, medium bitterness, taste of cereals....the original and one of the best pilsener."
"Bottle - clear, light lemony appearance. High initial carbonation giving frothy white head. Lemony aroma. Ting on tongue and in mouth - too carbonated. Slight metallic tasting - not enjoyed."
"Skunky aroma (green bottle), malt, herbs and a bit of butter. Taste is above average bitter with grains and caramel aftertaste. A very good lager."
"Clear amber with a white head. Good lacing. Soft and bitter with a light body. Hops in aroma, on palate and in aftertaste. B@H"
12oz bottle with commonmac. Straw gold with small white head. Smells of off grain. Sweet grain and malt. Pretty standard bad pilsner.
"Bottle. Clear amber with typical lager carbonation and head. Full fruity nose with blackcurrent hints. Refreshing fizzy wheaty flavour with bitter finish, clean and dry. Nice lager.

"2/6/16 Chicago (11.2 Oz Bottle (Best before 6/5/16 date) poured into Flute glass. Bright clear straw blonde colour, heavy immediate carbonation, slowed but steadied after initial pour. Medium white head, no lacing. Pleasant pilsner aroma of bread malt and grassy hops. Crisp clean dry taste, minimal hops, nice bitterness mix. Thin texture offset by solid carbonation mix, easy drinking. Overall good offering and I’ll enjoy the rest of the 12 bottles this winter."
"An old favorite from years gone by. PU is of course the ’UR’ brau, the original pilsner, and I believe it remains the benchmark for the style. Interesting 4-pack with various old style graphics on the 16+ oz. cans. By no means an adjunct beer, this is beer in its purest form, heavy on the malt, lighter on the hops, somewhat grassy, clear and clean, easy drinking... a classic. Poured into a 19 oz. pilsner glass, light foam, the ’soft’ water seems to give this beer its smooth mouth feel, like the original Burton-on-Trent Bass Ale."
Clear golden in appearance. Flavors include a sweet malty touch with hop presence. Hops take on a bitterness bite and some grassy notes. Finishes with honey aftertaste. Light bodied and well carbonated. Classic pilsner and never disappoints you.
"0,5l from tank. Yellow clear shiny colour, small white head. Smells off tobacco, butter, spices. Medium body, soft carbonation, slick mouthfeel. Tastes tobacco, grains, lightly buttery, some pepper, spices, light bread. Finishes lightly bitter with notes of tobacco and some grainy / buttery notes. not my kind of beer.."
"Canned, 50 cl. Pours clear gold with a decent head. Aroma: Butter, malt, grass. Pleasant. Taste: Medium sweet, malty flavour. Some grass. Pleasant bitter. Very pleasant. Buttery, smooth. Great drinkability. Palate: Medium-light body, average carbonation. Pleasantly bitter, grassy aftertaste. Excellent pilsner. I love it. 7-4-7-3-18.

"Clear golden, Tall dense fluffy head. Stays. Aroma of grains, hay, honey malts. Light to medium body. Thin to oily texture. Sweetish grainy malts & proper grassy hops on taste. Long hoppy finish. same aftertaste. Good."
"1 litre bottle. Nice golden color with a white head. Malts in aroma & taste. Medium bodied, lively carbonated. Pleasant bitter taste with a long finishing. Excellent."
"Golden with a big, frothy head. Hops-dominated nose of pine and grass with some malt. Rich hoppy flavour resulting in a long-lasting bitterness with a solid malt backbone. This is probably the one style where the original standard is still one of the most interesting versions, at least when fresh on tap in the Czech Republic..."
"Bottle, pours clear gold, large white head. Fresh aroma, very clean, bite of hops and hay, clear notes of honey on the aftertaste, bitter finish but very refreshing. I’ll have been delighted to have this during summer months. Classic pilsner."
"Tap at Lokal from the tank 1 day old!, ive had 15 or something of this wonderful brew in my 4 days in Prague. Pours golden with a white head. Aroma of hops, citrus, grainy, Fresh bread!, a tad more fresh than unfiltred verison. Wonderfull and perfect balance!"
"Pours clear golden. Aroma is malty, slight hops. Taste is clear, bread, malt. Finish has some hops."
"Can. Pours is golden clear with medium creamy white head. Aroma of grain, malts, straw, grass, light herbs. Taste is moderate bitter, lot of malts on tongue. Medium body, solid malty base, creamy texture, bitter finish."
"An iconic beer (I know because I have drunk it fresh in Prague) but the long trip to Australia definitely takes the edge off the Saaz dry hop bitterness and it is marked down accordingly. (330ml bottle, exp. 19/3/16)."
"12 oz bottle- Pale clear color, flavor tastes richly European, though not my style. Very drinkable, not a fan of the sweet flavor here. I hear people say this is the greatest pilsner of all time, personally I think they say that because It was the first pilsner of all time."
"12oz bottle pours crystal clear amber with small head. Nose is grainy corn, apple, cracker, light grass. Taste is bitter, dry, toast, cracker, cornbread, light apple and orangey malt. Finishes bitter, corn, grain. A bit sticky and not quite as snappy as I like my pilsners."
"I have long avoided this beer in my hometown. I know it won’t be fresh, so why bother right? A lot of people seem to be enamored by this one, so when I saw it on the shelf while in Europe I thought it would likely be quite a bit more fresh. After a few bottles, I like it well enough. Light and drinkable. Nothing to get overly excited about, but if its fresh I am not going to pass on it. This is what BMC should aspire to taste like."
"Clear golden yellow color with nce white head that disappears quickly. Aroma has malts, hops and grass with little herbs. Taste has bread with malts, light grass with nice hops bite.High carbonation. Good and refreshing pils!"
"I’m a beer snob. I prefer high gravity beers, particularly imperial stouts and porters and Belgian tripels. But when I want an every day beer, this is my choice. Enough said."
"500ml can. Small diminishing head, amber colour. Aroma is malt and herbs. Light to medium bitterness. Compared to most mass produced pilsners & lagers, has lots of taste to be savoured. Good."
"In aroma malts, hops. In taste malts, hops. Medium to low herbal bitterness."
"On tap, Pivnice U Rudolfina. Very clear golden colour with stable creamy white head. Aroma is of czech hops, some malty sweetness. Taste is hops with malty sweetness. Pleasant bitterness. Bitter aftertaste. Balanced. Good."
crystal clear golden color. wonderful creamy white head. aroma hoppy and dry. palatemedium. carbonation medium. taste clean balanced malt body with nice dry hoppy finish. very nice.
"12 oz bottle poured into a glass. Light golden orange with an unfiltered appearance. White frothy head. Aroma has faint hops with a slight metallic quality. Grassy. Taste is relatively crisp with a thin mouthfeel. Again a little metallic. Kind of bitter hoppiness with a grassy, earthy nature. Probably a step (small step) above run of the mill, prevalent pilsners. You can easily find it everywhere and can also probably easily find an alternative as well."
Bottle. A little malt aroma from the thin head. Sour taste without much flavor. Drinkable but not pleasant.
"Smell of a old dusty brewery, but in a good way. Straight away easily likable, passed the glass to my wife, had to wrestle it back off her, deforestation stock some in my fridge"
"Best of the mass produced pilsners. Crisp flavor, exceptionally refreshing on a summer day and low enough abv to be sessionable."
"A good example of the style. Way better than a lot of bland pilsners. Nothing exceptional, but well worth a try compared to its peers."
"Czech beer is the best in the world bar none, its so consistant. The beer is a true great pilsner . Hoppy aroma, good colour. Good balance of biterness and malt , its slightly skunky , but thats what sets euro lagers apart from generic beers. I agree with one of the guys tho there are better czech beers but my memory may fail me as to how they compare , I remember Zamek and staropramen being better."
"50 cl can. Dark yellow to golden, with minimal white head. Aroma is bread, hay, butter, some nuts, wood. Medium malty, light bitter, light acidic. Nice longish finish."
"Have had this beer many times. Definitely seems better from the 16oz can, which I am currently drinking. Earthy hop aroma, lemon, light grain malt, and cracker. Taste is of grass, light yellow fruits, malt and bread. Slight bitterness on the tongue, that lingers. Easy drinking. Not fucking bad."
"330ml bottle. Clear golden body with a big white crown. Thin aroma and flavor. Malty and fruity with elements of grain, biscuits, caramel and a bite of bitterness in the finish."
"We could probably say that it is the mother of the pils. If I compare with the schützengarden lager hell, I really feel a good weeding between the malt and the hop, It is an important friendship. The colour is yellow-gold and the foam doesn’t stay a long time in the pint. The sensation in the mouth is pleasant. I particulary love the pils during the summer with my family, when the wheather is hot. My critic is that they sold their soul to the evil of the neoliberalism and they sell that to a big group. It is a pity because it is a legend."
"I think mine was a bit skunked, so my experience may be off from what it should be. I could tell there was some creaminess to it, but really not a great beer experience for me. Nothing remarkable about it at all."
"Pours clear golden colour with firstly compact, creamy white head, which quickly vanish. Aroma of grain, similar are flavours. Taste is sweet, of grain, barley malts with nice hoppy note in finish. Low carbonation, medium bitterness. Nice little hoppy aftertaste. Alcohol abv. is low but you can feel the presence. Good pilsener."
From a bottle. Great example of a style which I don’t normally like. Just enough hop to balance the malt.
"Pale gold yellow color, a little clearer and less bubbly than czechvar.  Can pour a large grassy/straw smelling/tasting head if too warm.  
Iniital taste is saaz hops, but has some sour notes to it I dont care for.  Some malt character towards the finish, but this beer is too watery, and does not warm gracefully. Still, it has a crisp enough body while cold and has some straw/floral notes to some extent.…"
"Nutty-malty nose, a touch of pineyness. Medium malty body. Pleasant noble hop flavor, no overbittering. Pleasant bitter finish with no harshness. Very drinkable, beautifully balanced. A beer made to be enjoyed, not to be the bitterest at the beerfest."
"33cl bottle at CAD Cafe, Singapore on 30-Oct-2015. Light pale pilsner. Lots if bread, cereal and grain. Lively carbonation. Refreshing, but light on taste."
When your talking pilsner this is the standard all others are compared too. Great flavor easy to drink would recommend...

"18-NOV-2015. BOTTLE 50 CL. (Brewed in Plzeň. Fresh.) Clear golden, white frothy head. Nice bready aroma, traces of herbal hops which blend nicely into the malts. Some dusty grains too, and the hops could be stronger (it’s less than a month old!). Taste: dry, delicate bready malts, dusty grains. Strong herbal and spicy finish. The body is crisp and too prickly and over-carbonated. No usual industrial flaws. As good as a macro-pils can get.…"
"Bronze clear. White foam. Mild sweet malt aroma. Not much taste, malt sweet mildly bitter aftertaste."
"Bottle. Aroma: Malty, some diacetyl, herbal notes. Appearance: Golden, dense low head, even quite durable. Taste: Malt combined with herbal notes, low bitterness, quite sweet, light diacetyl, hay, not the same as the old Pilsner but still not so tragically bad in comparision with corpolagers sold in the same place. Palate: Carbonation is medium, body is medium-low, finish is semi-sweet."
"Light golden appearance with lots of creamy head that doesn’t last long. Tastes simply of bitter hops and grassy malt. Light body, very crispy carbonation and a lasting bitter finish. Refreshingly disappointing"
"I like Pilsener, but somehow I cant become acquainted with the original: it has a crisp beginning but the finish is nothing but foul. Maybe I dont like czech hops. Sorry."
"Beer at it’s finest, because there is nothing more to it , then the pure beer drinking experience. Herby hops aroma and a hayish malt character. With an aftertaste, that gives you a prickling and refreshing mouth feeling."
"Gold in color. Nice head. Crisp, hoppy taste. Slightly bitter, but not unpleasantly so. Very carbonated. These go down well in multiples on a hot summer day. Goes well with spicy food. A worthy representative of the style."

* Overall medium sweet, crisp, bready & grassy."
330ml bottle. May have been the green bottle and having to travel the distance it did but this was not as good as I had hoped.
"50 cl can from City Center One, served in a snifter. Dark yellow to golden, with minimal white head. Aroma is floral, Saaz hops, malts. Full body, low carbonation. Taste is crisp, medium sweet, with pleasant medium to medium-high bitterness in the finish. Oily texture."
"This is the classic. Forget about bottles and cans, also most of the KEG places screw the beer up. You have a good chance of encountering this beer in good condition only in places that draft it from special serving tanks. If it is served properly it can be delicious. Thick and lasting white head, clear golden colour, moderate to high carbonation. Soft noble hops aroma and balanced taste with moderate bitterness and subtle hops flavour and simple malty base. Moreish and sessionable."
"Can (about 473ml).
Pours blond with medium white head. Good lacing. Aroma is of malt, flowers, saaz. Taste is of pilsner malt, bitterness, flowers, saaz. Palate: Light body. Medium carbonation. Overall: Nice, easily drinkable."
"The one and only, real pilsner. I must say I really love this beer. True masterpiece either draft or bottle. Draft; you can spot visually very easily when this beer is not fresh, always check someone ordering before you place an order in the bar. It can taste really nasty when old. Bottle; serving temperature is vital. Full body, nice bitterness, strong hop aroma/finish. If you don’t like this pilsner what pilsner do you like ?"

"12oz bottle, as part of a mixed six my uncle gave me for driving him to the airport. He says this one is his favorite beer of all beers. A Bohemian Pilsner? Never sampled the style before. Hard to tell what the difference is. Clear yellow color, minimal white head. All I can say is that it’s a very good pilsner aroma. Carbonation gives a sharp tingle that peaks through the finish. A slight variation, interesting and a bit more bitter, in a sea of boring and skunky pale lagers, I can see why my Uncle loves this beer. 6/3/6/3/11…"

Update: as I drink more stuff, I start to like Urquell more and more. It is very flavorful…"
"It has great serious and persistent foam, good flavor of a little malt, but most hops. Medium fullness with only a hint of malt sweetness. Hop bitterness with its seductive floral notes soon takes over, and hops are the most urgent flavor note in Urquell. It may be a model for the world lagers, but this is not a lager that push me out of your seat excitement. Preserved - it is as certain type of real, rich and tasty, but more praise deserve it nor."

"100th rated & a fine beer it is, mild floral malty aroma, the taste is lightly bitter crisp & fruity, very smooth & refreshing overall"
"Bottle pours amber with one-inch head. Smells of cereal, grain, and a hint of tobacco. It’s got a bigger body than most pilsners, but I could use more flavor and hop scent. Overall, not bad but would much rather have it on tap."
"It’s smooth, yet bubbly, like my personality. I’ve been craving pils lately. This one has a bit more flavour than most. Czech beer for the masses. Some light skunky bitterness. The green bottles are killing me. While do they do that? Maybe the beer doesn’t really taste much better in good condition? Best experience was in a plastic cup with a sausage from a street vendor in Prague. Stella, Heineken, Urquell - what’s the difference really?"
"Perfect pour. A: sweet malts, nice bitter aroma, refreshing and inviting. T: very smooth Pilsener, softest water I have ever had in a beer. No weird bitter spikes, very smooth taste development. Crisp mouthfeel. Thirst quencher, but also nice to just enjoy."

"On tap with markoijelena at the Belgrade Beer Fest in Serbia. Pours bright golden color, a bit hazy, incredibly persistent white foamy head. Nose: milled pilsner malts, straw, bread crust. Mouth: medium carbonation, balanced richness of malty notes, cookies too. Bitter end."
"500 ml bottle. Famous, and great! Sweet malts smell, a fire golden color with a low white head. Taste like a sweet pilsen with some great ending."

"Actually, my intention was to not rate this, just leave a comment... RateBeer don’t allow this, so here we go... Beeing THE pilsner, the original, very first pilsner, this should cleerly have a solid 100 points for the style. Trying to discuss if this is up to the standards of correct style or not, is redicolous. 66 points overall just tells me it’s a lot of people that don’t like pilsner that have rated it. ’Nough said from this grumpy old man :-)"
"11.2 oz. bottle. Pours amber with small, quickly diminishing white head. Aroma is skunky and grassy. Taste is bitter and skunky."

"Super clear pale straw, bright white head. Honey biscuit nose with a touch of old world hops. Flavor is spicy hops, simple pilsner malt, and minerally/sulfury lager yeast. Everything is perfectly balanced. What a classic pils."
No lager fan but this is decent by anyone’s standard crisp and clean packed full of malts decent carbonation.
"500ml can...spicy noble hop flavor and aroma. Biscuity, slightly herbal malt backbone. Refreshing easy drinker."
"One of the best pilsners. Very refreshing. Nor much of an aroma, and generally boring appearance. But solid beer."
"From tap. Clear golden color with white head. Malty grainy aroma, grassy, noble hoppy. Sweet and bitter taste. Light to medium thin to oily body with average carbonation."
"Can 0,5l. Clear old gold color liquid with white head. Medium body, medium to heavy carbonation. Aroma of cabbage and cornbread. Taste is similar to smell with some sourness and sweetness. Sourish aftertaste."
"First beer I ever drank. I remember disliking it at the time (2001). Can, into a spiegelau IPA glass. Very clear gold pour with a foamy white head. Relatively little lacing. Lemony, floral, straw bale nose with faint yeasty funk. Light body. Crackery malt, pine, floral and grassy hops. Some lemon peel, marigold. None of the off-flavors I’ve experienced in the past. Crisp. A classic."
"Slight hoppy flavor, with a little bit of bitterness. Has a good strong flavor that hides the skunk, so that you can barely taste it. I’m not a huge pilsner fan, but this is better than alot of them."
Golden with medium white head. Dry moderate hoppy bitterness which stays in the aftertaste. Other components only for the bitterness balance.
"Bottle and on tap at the Clarkston Union, I only buy this beer in 12 packs which are enclosed and shielded from light, otherwise, the beer will be skunky, pours a clear medium gold with honey gold and browns hints, has a good amount of effervescence, initially had a two to three finger high brilliant white head that recedes to a ring and cover, head was white and foamy looking, leaves some nice lacing on he glass, aroma of grass and flower hops, malt, light bread and light sweetness on the nose (if you buy single bottles or six packs the beer will be skunky because it is exposed to light),…"
"After a long journey over the years, through all the beer styles that I could find, this is the only brew that I always enjoy without reservations."
"Can. Clear yellow colour and a small white head. Aroma has notes of caramel and malt. Medium sweetness and medium bitterness in the taste. Nice balance. Light body, average carbonation, bitter finish. A good czech pilsner."
"Pretty good, some of that distinctive pleasant hoppy floral armpit aroma of a Euro lager with some nice ballsy bitterness."
"Malt flavors are mild, just slightly sweet and bready. Hops are mild to moderate, resiny in aroma, with just a slight touch of lemon, maybe a hint of herbs. Yeast is doughy and fairly distinct.

Amber to gold color; clear; small just slightly off-white head.…"
"The beer has a dark color, with a little hint of orange. The Beer looks like morning urine, exactly the same color and the same little foam on top of it. The smell is very bitter, which is very nice. There is also a little sweetness in the smell. The taste has the same bitterness as the smell. The bitterness is clearly caused by the hops. There is also a nice citrusy hop taste. Very nice. The beer has a nice gassiness, which results in a nice palate."
"50cl, 33cl, Tap starting from 1997. I really do not agree with the description here especially. Yes, this is an exceptional pilsner, but there are also decent competitors. Perfectly balanced. Good with potato crisps/chips and som dry roasted pork. No need to describe the taste - you probably know that it is good already. Tap in Pudel Bar Tallinn is actually rather good. Thank You."
"Sadly the best pilsner I’ve tasted during past two weeks. But standard pilsner, nothing special."
Review based on the BJCP2015 guidelines (style 3B). Can 50 cl - Batch L1131 20:45 AROMA: slight cereal aroma mixed with diacetyl and slight plastic (HDPE) notes. no hop aroma discernible. APPEARANCE: golden color and translucent. thin white and moussy head with low retention. TASTE: cereal flavour mixed with some diacetyl. medium-low bitterness with a slight dry finish. PALATE: medium-low body with moderate-low carbonation. OVERALL: a czech pilsener sample with minor faults and without much hop presence.
"Bottle shared with my dad. Dark golden pour with a frothy head. Notes of caramel, hay, grass and biscuits."
"Deep golden with a big white head. Aroma is bread, biscuit, caramel, nice herbal and floral notes. Same in taste with a nice citric/herbal bitterness. Bitter aftertaste."

".5l pour from tap into beer mug at Brickmakers Ale and Cider House in Vienna, Austria. Tank beer, unpasteurized, tapped three days ago. Looks perfect. Deep gold, only the slightest bit hazy, and a beautiful fluffy cloud-like head. The head is awesome creamy, and the beer has a great body, crisp and smooth. Not much on the nose. Maybe a hint of bread and hay. Nothing too notable, good or bad. Taste is nice. Biscuity and bitter, especially at the finish. Middle has some grassy notes too. It’s not a crazy complex beer, but what it does, it does well. Very refreshing."

"Tap at some bar in Prague 2. Frosty glass and poured almost clear, golden, big fluffy, compact white Head. The aroma is clean and crisp, a biscuity malt smell, grass, citrus, fresh corn. Light body, dry and fresh mouthfeel, medium carbonated. Taste is sweet malt, cake, grass, mild hops. Crisp and sweet finish."
"0,5 l glass at Pilsner Urquell brewpub in Plzen. Amazing experience. Golden colour with average head.Light resin and herbal hops moderate malty and sweet. Good body and nice carbo. Bottled doesn’t taste so good."

"Diggin’ the 16 ounce can. No more skunk! Several can designs made me think they we’re different beers. Anyway, slightly hazy, more golden than a BMC Pilsner, decent head and nose. Crisp is the operative word, but the grains are slightly sweet. Saaz hops are floral and provide a little bite. Goes down easy for any veteran beer drinker."
"Clear golden coloured with a small white head. Aroma of malts and hops. Flavour of fruits, malts and hops. Dry hoppy finish."

"Gold, very bubbly, with a medium white head. Aroma is yeasty, slightly skunky despite a NOV2215 date. Flavor is pretty good, though. Good Pils."
"Well, its a pilsner, but one of the better ones. Fairly hoppy for its kind, certainly more than most industrialized pilsners."
"Yellow colour, creamy white head, aroma of saaz hops, hay, grass, lager yeast. Taste is slightly bitter, very refreshing and drinkable, light body slick oily texture, average to fizzy carbonation. One of the best pilsners when it is from a tank."
"330 mL bottle. Pours golden with a thin white head. Simple cereals on the nose with modest breadiness, floral Saaz hops with light perfume tones. Grain sweetness up front with a lightly bitter finale. Light bodied, average carbonation and a clean aftertaste. Too bad American macro doesn’t taste this good."
"Drank at S&G big pilsener tasting, blindly comparing 24 pilseners. Taste for most pilseners was the same, some grains, bit hoppy, quite malty and mostly bit metallic. 
On this tasting, this was the worst of all... Bottle was preserved well and didn’t expire... Hope to try it again though, since other ratings are better"
"Not green bottle, brown bottle. 11.2 oz americanized and lost it’s aroma and the high notes (sweet?). Bitter after taste and watered down.
Who changed the original, this tastes awful.
It has gone the way of the American Becks which is not the German Becks, ""German style"" means not good!!!!!!"

Poured from a number of different looking tall boy cans sold as singles. Very crisp and the perfect signature euro bitter bite. Reminds me of Germany where they know what a pils is.

"Golden color and minimal head.
Hoppy aroma but with some malt.
Bitter taste... very well balanced!
A great beer, classic!"
About 3 years ago I tried this beer in a bottle and found it to be a little too bitter for my taste. Czechvar was my preferred pilsner at that time. This week I enjoyed an Urquell on tap with a roast-beef sandwich and it tasted much better than my memory of the bottled one. The beer was clear and crisp with a slight hint of apple flavor that I enjoy so much in stella artois but much less pronounced here. The bitterness that I remembered was gone and I will definitely have it again next time I’m at that bar.

"Smooth start and light flavors. Not much in hops, high in malt. Sharp end note is abrupt and fierce. Its good for one not a pitcher."
"Golden color, nice head, aromas of spices with a bit of citrus, sweet with finishing herbal notes."
"For sure the best low fermentation beer I have ever had. Looks a bit artificial, so clear with the filtration, and very thin head. Aroma is hoppy. Taste is crisp hops, with a touch of malt sweetness. Sad I don’t like those lager weird malts. Dry and fairly bitter. Well done for what it is. [#103]"
"Probably the best beer I’ve ever tried. Thumbs up! It’s rather difficult to find it in my country, which is too bad, but it will definitely be a reason more for me to travel.

"Bottle BBE: 24/7/15. Well-chilled. Pours between amber and gold, completely clear, with a moderate white head that dissipates quickly. Head a little patchy. Fresh, sweet, bready aroma with a perceptible, peppery hop character. A prolonged biscuity sweetness is balanced by a medium bitterness. Light-bodied, fizzy, foamy texture and a lasting, classic Pilsner taste. The gold standard in lager."
"After finally going to a brown bottle, I find that this is a basic, easy to drink pilsner, sentimental choice."
"Bottle. Another classic Pilsner. Compared to Budvar, this one has a drier flavor, more bitterness and a richer colour. Re-rate: Raising the score a bit. Clean classic taste and since it’s the original Pilsner it’s not possible to say that it’s generic. This is a very finely tuned Pilsner and when it’s relatively fresh it always delivers. Bonus points for being widely available"
Not bad. It’s always good to try a foreign beer. I love this taste for sure!
"Reviewing from Pilsen at main square on tap. Medium aroma of oxidized spicy hops. The malt aroma is grainy sweet but also swords oxidation. Wonderful guild color with brilliant clarity and send white head. As with aroma, oxidation muddies the spicy Saaz and Moravian malt flavors. Bitterness is correct but s harsher than a normal pils. Medium body and adequate carbonation with minor astringency. Dry finish with slightly astringent aftertaste. Pasteurization and sloppy packaging seems to ruin one of the best beers in the world."

UHH I DONT LIKE BELGIUMS BUT THIS ONE IS NOT GOOD. I LIKE DRINKING AMERICA OR CANADA. WAY BETTER THAN THIS PEEPEE. IT SMELL LIKE SKUNK OR MY CUSIN HOUSE. AND LET ME TELL YOU IM STICKING WITH PLINY(DELISCHIOUS) AS MUCH AS I CAN.
"I’ve had this beer a number of times, but finally decided to review it. It pours a nice clear, deep gold color which is the appearance I like from a pils. Not a super high amount of carbonation. Aroma is mostly sweet. Definitely get some of that light malt aroma as well as a light fruit smell. I also want to say it smells a little buttery. The hoppy taste is very prevalent right up front. The flavor is mostly a mild bitterness. Otherwise, it’s super crisp, clean, and dry which make a decent pilsner."
"Pint can. Pours a pale gold, clear, fluffy white head with nice retention and lacing. Nose is about what you’d expect in a Pilsner. Taste is as well. Admittedly not my favorite style by a long shot, but it was on sale and I figured might as well finally give it a try. Pretty much exactly what I expected... but in a can there was no danger of skunk."
"Second tasting. New brown bottle, 500ml. Tesco. Scent is mild, medium pale malt with a bit of sweetness. Pours light amber with a thin white head subsiding quickly. Transparent. Taste is dense pale malt and medium pilsner yeast. FInish is light, maybe a little lackluster. Very good."

"Fresh, Czech purchased bottle. Pours dark yellow, with a big creamy head settling to finger thickness. Aroma is zesty hops and grassy notes, as well as roasted malts with bread and light notes of butter. Medium to full body, with soft carbonation.

"12 oz. bottle from Trader Joe’s. The nose gives off a slight whiff of skunk that doesn’t come through in the taste. Pours yellow with a white head that settles down to a thin cap. Tasty Pilsen malt transitions to Saaz hops bitterness. Dry, with great balance. Bready aftertaste. A solid go to pilsner. Love the low ABV."
"A nice surprise. Honey and grass is obvious then a waft of hops. Leaves real bitterness at the back of the mouth and sweetness in the lips. Bitterness is just this side of too much. Carbonation is light for the style, generates a head but it doesn’t stick around long. At only 4.4% it tastes pretty grown up."

On my second trip to Prague just recently (2015), I discovered Lokal, which was said to pour the best Urquell in the city.

Saaz hops are very expensive and this brewer uses plenty!"
"33 cl can@friends house. I was never a fan of that distinct Czech malt hop combination which is so prevalent in the Urqell, long praised by people around me. I do not find it fresh enough for a pilsner. However, I did find this drink better than the discount Czech beers which have come to market in Denmark. Nice aroma, good head and quite a nice taste with plenty of hop and a good bitterness. Will never be my first choice, but better than I remembered it."
"330 ml bottle. I can’t believe I have never rated this. One of my earliest memories of drinking imported beers was the first time I drank this pils back in the late 1970’s. It was bold and hoppy, like nothing I ever tasted before. Now it seems so tame and pedestrian, but I respect my roots and pay homage to a true iconic style and brewery. Bright brassy gold with a brief white head. Aroma is grainy malt with a fresh Saaz hop character. Flavor is crisp, sweet malt and herbal hops. Finish is dry and complex with a noticeable dry bitterness."

"I do love a good pilsner, but alas for me this is not one of them.  It’s the dry bitterness combined with a taste which to me is a little stale that make this a beer I typically avoid. 2.2 Total Score
2015 Rerate - stock being cold shipped to NZ so interested to relook at this beer.  Found it to be a little more vibrant and seems sweeter than I remember which takes the edge off the bitterness which I disliked so much last time. Still not a knock it out…"

A Pilsner at it s best."
"Bottle 500 ml. Some grassy pilsner aroma, with distinguishable hops and malts. Clear golden colour, frothy head. Nice bitterness, quite an aftertaste."
Straw golden color. Nice white head. Slightly grassy hop aroma. Bitterness with a solid light malt. Rich carbonation. Refreshing!
Avarage beer for me. Grass aroma and golden color. Medium bitterness taste. Expected more from this beer
"It’s always a nice surprise when something you expect to be terrible turns out to be quite nice. Bottle- dark golden with a foamy beige head which sticks around a while. Aroma of light toasted malts, pine, hay and a little yeast. Taste is of lemon, hay, honey and a light bitterness to finish. Quite dry bodied, medium carbonation."
"Clear pale body with high frosty head. Aroma is malty, noble, clean. Taste has medium malty sweetness with long lasting high earthy bitterness, noble after taste, crisp. Balanced towards the bitterness. Body is medium, full carbonation. A classic."

Is the benchmark of the style - no? A safe bet when choosing a hot weather thirst quencher. Might be questionable otherwise...
"330ml bottle into glass. Grassy hop nose with a little spice/sweetness. Inviting. Pours amber with sudsy head. Taste is clean bitterness. Finish is a little malt, then lasting citric bitters. Nice."
"50cl bottle at home. It pours a clear golden colour with a very large fluffy white head. Aroma is of a very crisp pilsner malts, floral hops with some citrus. Taste is crisp and with a clean flavour, bready malts, hoppy bitterness, little citrus and some sweetness. It has a light body and heavily carbonated. This beer is considered by many as the original pilsner and among the best of their style. And in my view, it well deserves its reputation. I would drink it again."
"I just dont like pilsner very much I think. The flavor was ok but not great, even from a tap"
Thought the bitburger right before was nicer and slightly hoppier. Also malts were more protruding in the German bier.
"A deep yellow beer with a almost medium and white head. Aroma is balanced and quite nice, grass is dominating, malts and some honey. Taste is malty, quite dry and lot of hops, long and grassy aftertaste. Medium- bodied, smooth to drink. Pure malty and medium bitter with lots of grass, enjoyable beer."
"Can. Clear golden body, medium to thin white head, spotty lacing. Clean floral and citrus notes with soft crackery and cerealy grains. Medium to light bodied, moderate to lively carbonation, modest bitterness in the finish."
On tap. Pours a dark clear copper with fine head. Aromas of  light toasted malts. Flavors of grass and biscuits with a very light sweetness. Resin and hops in the finish.
Draft that pours clear golden yellow with big fluffy white head. Aroma is that clear crisp clean pils malt. Somewhat aromatic with a finish of hops. Taste is more of the same. Just clean and crisp with a mild to mefo bitterness on the end. Excellent example of the style.

"Very little smell, clear golden yellow color, short lasting foam. The taste is slightly bitter but rather lagery. Very nice lager, but nothing more."
"Non filtered,I have been told, is much better. But even this crystal clear famous ""mother"" pilsner of all pilsners is very good everyday beer. I think this is the only one beer that did not change original taste after takeover of gigantic brew companies (I hate them). So, cheers and Happy New Year!"
"Bottle. Golden colour, clear, medium size head, mostly diminishing, showing fair lacing. Aroma is mostly of herbs, plus some malt and wort. Light bitterness. Ok, but nothing special."

Drank from a bottle. Quite basic but there is still something more. Maybe the slight bitterness.
0.5l draught. Clear orange color with medium white head. Aroma of burnt malt. Taste is light sour and pleasantly bitter. Appreciate the difference from other beers.
"0.5 draught beer. Medium lasting thick head, golden/honey colour. There is aroma of something roasted. Little bitter taste."
"Can. Pours bright, clear gold, big white head. Some retention/lace. Aroma of grain, grassy/spicy saaz, light soap. Taste is lightly bitter, grassy, grain, bread, some sweetness. Palate is average carbonation, light body, spicy bitter finish. Pretty damn good for $1.25/pint can."
"Keg in the Racehorse, Kettlewell. Golden with a frothy white head. Notes of citrus and caramel. Light and refreshing."
"Dark, but transparent golden yellow with many bubbles. No head. Typical cereal oriented pilsner aroma, but heavier emphasis on honey. Much more impressed with the taste. Maintains a smooth and refreshing texture that is true to the style, yet manages to introduce minor complexities. Initially, the stereotypical pilsner flavour prevails with cereals, honey, and grass, but the finish manages to have a slight bitter hop that makes this one unique. Good."
"0.5 can. Clear, gold color and a small, white head. Aroma is not especially alluring - it’s an odd mix of vegetables and honey; while certainly interesting it isn’t something one particularly enjoys. Taste is full of Czech hops and pale malts - quite sweet actually, not the same bitter hops as I remember from a few years back. Medium body, creamy texture, and soft carbonation. Finish is medium-long and honey-induced again. Overall a nice brew, a classic in its style."

Appears very clear golden with immense foamy white head formation that lasts quite a while and leaves traces of lace on the side of the glass. Aroma has subtle notes of biscuit and grassy hops.

"Poured from bottle, hazy gold with low head. Aroma strong with notes of toast, bread and hay. Taste is bitter at first, then quickly gives way to some sweetness and a dissolving finish."
Very good session beer. Pilsner isn’t something I normally drink but this one is good.
"Looks a little more orange than most pilsners, without much of a head. Aroma is yeasty, doughy, and a little floral. Absolutely delicious to drink. Tons of floral and herbal hops over honey and bread. Solid, easy to find and generally cheap."
"Rated from notes taken 7 Oct 2011 -- Purchased and consumed for Pilsner Urquell’s 169th birthday! Definitely a classic Pilsner, clean refreshing and delicious."
Delicious fresh bread malt character with enough freshness of hay and green grass and lemon zest. Commercially textured but plenty of flavour in a dry palate with well balanced bitterness
"Decent pilsner. Pours pale golden color, minimal head. Clear, sparkly, and crisp. Very refreshing. Short bitter finish. Good, but it wasn’t great. Hight expectations since it had been talked up by folks in Germany."
"Had numerous times in bottles, keg in Prague.  This time it’s the ’Tank beer’ version, keg at White Horse Parson’s Green.  Pale orange, clear, lightly sparkling, big foamy white head leaves sparse lacing.  Aroma is bread and bubblegum.  Body is light, foamy, medium carbonation.  Taste is malty, white bread, malted milk biscuits, some straw and background bubblegum, soft bitterness."
"Clear gold, strong white head. Maltiness and Saaz hop on the nose. Lovely. Sweet, malty body with notes of bitter and a distinct hoppiness. The Pilsner of Pilsners indeed!"
Ok it is a very hard to rate this beer. Because rating a bottle would not be to fair especialy if you find one after 5 monts from production date... Going to one of the best beerpubs in Prague would not reflect what Pilsner Urquell is in general...

"Unpasteurized edition, 1L bottle. BBD 3/12/14. Very clear light golden with medium bubbly off-white head. Aroma of honey, floral, some graininess. Clean flavor, slightly sweet, moderate sourness, notes of honey, floral, corn sugar, malty, bitter-sweet finish, not so pleasant bitter aftertaste. Light carbonation, light-bodied. Very easy to drink."
"Let’s get this out of the way, first. I hate the green bottle. Having said that, Pilsner Urquell is to the Czech Pilsner what Guinness Draught is to the Irish Dry Stout; a popular import that is viewed as an old-fashioned example of the style and its indigenous land. For better or worse, that mindset certainly enhances the appeal of these beers. All that aside, this is a fine example of the Czech Pilsner. Smooth with a crisp, hoppy finish. Overall, quite satisfying."
"On tap it just looks fantastic, great nose of hops and fruits.
Fruity and hoppy taste, my first thougt is always like this tastes so good if you’re thirsty. Long lasting bitter finish.
When the place takes care of their tap it just tastes fantastic, the best pilsener to me. Was at a few places where it was considerably less tasty, so while in czech republic…"
330 ml bottle. Clear golden with white head. Fizzy. Smell is light grain and bread with hay grass hops. Taste is light grain and bread with a bitter grass hop finish. Dry with medium bitterness and medium carbonation.
"330ml bottle, so it’s not at it’s freshest, and this is a style that suffers for that. The nose gives off a whiff of skunk that fortunately doesn’t come through on the tongue. A nice crisp pilsener, some grains in the background. The Saaz hops are light so they don’t overwhelm the malt."

As it warms, the hops come more forward. Light medium body with a somewhat slick oily texture. Above normal carbonation with good effervescence on the finish and also in the middle. Very well done and it allows the Saaz hops to really shine in the middle. The flavor profile is intense for a Pilsner, well balanced and has a bit of complexity. It begins with a burst of Saaz hop flavor over a light biscuit sweetness. The middle is…"

"The first beer I have ever had in my life was a bottled Pilsner Urquell and I’ll never forget, how it tasted for me at that moment - it was a sensation which made me immediately fall in love with beer, this sensation was something that has since then never came back to me in such a powerful way.

"Bottle 0,5l, deep gold body, white head. Aroma weak, only notes of hop extracts. In flavor fresh, refreshing bitterness, sweet tones of malt. Aftertaste bitter. Light watery body, medium carbonation. 
Good one for hot days, but nothing special. And most famous czech pilsener without real hop? Only with extracts? I don’t think this is the beer what gave name for whole style... today it is much more like pale lager than pilsner, so pity."
"I don’t get it. Keep trying with this beer but this’ll be my last until I grab a can or visit the Czech Republic. 500ml bottle from the supermarket. Looks amazing when poured. Lovely golden and inviting. Slightly floral, grassy aroma. Dry almost savoury flavour similar to Staropramen, the hops don’t shine. Not a satisfying, come back and get me taste. I honestly think people are nostalgic and praising the invention of this original pilsner. Not changed since 1842 apparently but I’ve read different. Not a special beer, sorry!"

"This beer is a very clear, golden straw color with a medium white head, and the aroma blends light malts and some really citrusy, flowery hops. This beer is slightly sour and mildly sweet with an aftertaste that is a very light extension of the flavor. The palate fuses an average carbonation, medium body, and a thin texture that is somewhat obstructed by the carbonation."
Tried long ago. adding just for statistics. Some malt and hops. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Drinkable

Medik bitter taste, some corn syrup sweetness, watery. However fresh being a pilsner. Ok hoppyness"
"Bottle, bright amber, fine white head. Aroma is light malt, grain, yeast. Flavor is malt, slightly sour/sweet juicy, lager nuttiness, and faintly bitter hops finish. Palate is light, carbonation is bright, but nice for the style. To answer the previous reviewer, I don’t like lagers in general, but if I’m gonna drink a light lager, this is what I want."
"No carbonation when poured into a glass. Is this a beer or wine? Light bitter with an aftertaste, yet lacking any distinctive flavor. Drank very cold."

Aroma is moderately malty (toasted grain/bread, cereal), lightly to moderately hoppy (herbs, flowers), with light notes of men’s cologne and honey.  Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter.  Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately bitter.  Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.  Still one of the best mega-brews in the world (when reasonably fresh and unskunked)."

Clear and gold with nice legs supporting a lasting creamy film on top. Nose is sweet grain and dry grass. Flavor is more cereal and sweet malt than the typical imitators, and I can really taste the lemon-grass of the Saaz. Palate is slightly thick, and smooth with a medium carbonation. Body is heavier than most imitators - tending towards medium. Probably my least favorite style, but I gotta give this one…"
"0.5L bottle. Pours a clear golden with a rocky white head and decent lacing. Aromas are herby hop, hay and cooked vegetables (canned corn). Mild sweetness at the beginning and middle, with resiny, piney and herby hop flavor that develops to a dry hop linger, though not overpowering bitterness. Medium body with a creamy(ish) mouthfeel and average carbonation. Overall, really a tasty pilsener (the original!). Nice hop flavor, good balance, and nice mouthfeel all around."
"Clear golden body with a medium white head. Aroma is malt, fruity hops. Taste is medium sweet with light bitterness. Crisp."
"Canned. Beautiful crystal gold in the glass. Smells beery/bready with a fruity hops twang. Good beer flavor with some hops zest and a slightly buttery aftertaste. Not exceptional, but very well made. My go-to pilsner."
"Golden yellow beer with small but nice head and some lacing too. Aroma has grassy hops, butter and malts. Taste starts with buttery malts, then grassy hops kick in and ends with a dry hop flavor. Everything in great balance. Surprisingly bold body for the alc. content and medium carbonation. Still not as good as the wooden keg version, but still a Pilsner Urquell."
Meh. Nothing out of the ordinary but I had to at least try one of them. Lacks in things like flavor.
"Just good clean fun here. This was one of the first beers I ever really dug, long before I knew what a hophead was, or that I was one. So this beer is like an old childhood friend that I don’t really talk to anymore. There’s certainly nothing remarkable about it, other than its OG status, but it’s still pretty damn drinkable. The nose isn’t much, but it’s pleasant. Taste is the same: grain and Noble hops, with a finish just dry enough to make a hophead like me want to keep drinking. Like I said, just good clean fun."

Pours golden yellow from the can and forms a pretty thick fluffy head that quickly reduces to an uneven thin foam. Initial sweetness is followed by a short-lasting bitter aftertaste. Not much in terms of taste and aroma beyond some bitter citrus zests.
"A great Czech pils. According to me, you can’t get more flavor out of a bottom-fermented beer than this."
"Wet grass, herbs aroma. Rich malty flavor, then bitter herbal hops, dry finish. Pretty aggressive in bitterness and hops do lack flavors. This is surely part of beer history, but I’m very glad that a newer part of history is being written right now by so many young talented brewers."
"Golden color, good taste and smooth. It is very drinkable but not so week taste. And it's also good not too expensive."
"Clear golden, minimal white head. Cereals and malts on nose, similar to the mash. Light body with cereals and a dry hoppy bitterness."
"Very clear gold pilsner with a quickly fading head. Malt and mineral water, slightly dry and sweet finish. Well balanced and refreshing but like all lagers little substance"
"Pours a light golden,some white foam. Aroma is malts,hops. Taste follows suit,very crisp,refreshing. Awesome."
Just had a pint of this the other day - didn’t realize I hadn’t rated this. Pours golden with a little initial foam. Average carbonation. Nice note of saaz hops here with a little crisp barley. Great for easy drinking. Tap at an Italian restaurant.
"Amber color quickly disappearing white foam. Very malty aroma, sweet and acid at the same time, with citric hints. Taste of malts, hops, citrus and floral. Smooth bittersweet aftertaste. Very good Pilsner."
"Finally getting around to rating this. never bothered before as it was so readily available. ive had great times drinking this with workmates, particularly in the pub. pours clear sparkling yellow with a fluffy white head. aroma of honey, zest, grassy hops, yeast. taste is slightly sweet, malty, with a bitter finish. clean and crisp. not huge carbonation but still so refreshing. honestly its great to have such a tasty important beer on tap everywhere here"
"Sour, tea leaves, restrained fruit hoppiness. Nice medium body and mouthfeel. The original pilsner and not boring"
I had great hope that Urquell pilsener tasted good but it’s not my cup of tea. The taste is sour and the smell is awfull.
not a bad beer have had a few times quite a nice beer i get a creamy buttery finish have only had it on the tap never in bottles
"pours golden straw, with thin white head. good clean pils malt aroma. Taste is crisp and bitter, very clean and refreshing"
"Can 50cl. Foamy medium white head. Aroma is flowers, leaves and malt. Taste is dry with malt and leaves."
From a bottle. Disappointing skunky and sour. No depth and I had expected a lot in getting it in Czech Republic. I always thought that US versions I had tasted must just have travelled poorly. Nope.
"hay, floral, leaves, clove, golden, clear, minimal head, medium sweetness, medium bitterness, medium sourness, medium body, creamy, lively, bitter,"
"500 ml can, pours clear golden with a medium white foam head that quickly reduced. Aroma of white bread, hay, honey, apricots and herbs. Taste is dry and bitter with a slight sweetness. Light-medium body with good carbonation. A delicious Czech Pilsner, available relatively cheap and fresh almost everywhere in Europe."
"Urquell has gone industrial. Bitter, medicinal Euro-pilsner flavor that’s not especially thirst-quenching. Original formulation can be found in 400-gallon tanks under 3 pubs in Prague, but that’s a different story."
"500 ml can. Pours a clear golden yellow with a medium sized, frothy white head. Aroma has notes of malt, hay, grain and hops. Flavour is light sweet, with caramel malt and a light, dry, hoppy bitter finish. Medium body, oily texture and soft carbonation."
"Bottle. Probably one of the best pilsners I have had. With a great toasty malt, with hints of honey, bread, and some nice spicy hop taste. It finishes with a crisp, bitter aftertaste. A touch of skunk though, probably due to the green bottle and how far it came."
Large supermarket bottle. Pours a golden colour with small white head. Aroma isn’t great. Slightly sweet with a touch of hoppy bitterness in the finish. Light bodied and drinkable.
"Kind of skunky, bready, and a malty sweetness. Crisp and skunky, but not terrible."
"Pale golden color, medium white head. Hoppy aroma with some malt and grassy notes. Taste is dry with pleasant bitter finish and hoppy aftertaste. Medium body and soft carbonation. Nice pilsner."
"Bottle. Grainy aromas, and a touch skunky. Perhaps not the freshest bottle. Flavour was slightly better than expected. Some sweet grainy malt with a light hoppy character. Light carbonation. Better than some of its competition, but still not great."
"Aroma: Sweet hay and cracker with a light noble hop presence. Appearance: Well carbonated yellow gold with a foamy white head that mostly stuck around. Flavor: Matched the nose; malts are mostly crackery dry, but have a slightly sweet edge; noble hops come in more toward the finish and really cleanse the palate of the malt sweetness nicely. Palate: Light body, sticky texture, lively carbonation, bitter finish. Overall: Really loved this; drank it all afternoon quite happily. Found the 4 pack pint cans for 5.49, and thought they were far superior to the bottles I’ve had before."
"12 oz. bottle from Wilbur’s. Appearance: Finger white head, golden yellow, clear, Aroma: malty sweetness, light caramel, leafy yeast, bread, floral hops. Palate: light body, average carbonation, bitter finish, thin texture. Taste: big malt sweetness into medium hops bitterness, maybe slightest astringency in the transition. Overall, very nice pilsner, still not my style though."
"500ml can. Pours a crystal clear, golden yellow with a prolific, two finger, white head that fades quickly. Aroma has big malty notes balanced with some traditional hops. Very slightly fruity. Taste is balanced. Malty notes with a hint of fruityness. Medium-full body and carbonation. Fuller mouth feel. Not really watery for a 4.4% beer. 
Overall pretty tasty. Not my favorite beer but certainly not bad. The original pils!"
bottle. Pours a golden color with minimal white head. Aroma is skunky. Slightly sweet with some hoppy bitterness in the finish. Light bodied and drinkable. Decent if you can get past the aroma.
"Had this on draught at a Lebanese restaurant and it stood up surprisingly well with the food. Clear golden colour, well carbonated, white head. More aroma than you usually get from a pilsner, floral notes. Tasty, with grass, hops, bread coming through. With so much dross around, it’s nice to be reminded what a good pilsner tastes like."
Of course skunk on the nose. Then golden grain fields with a hint of maple syrup. Finally generous saaz hops. Czechs make the best golden lagers.
"Crystal clear beer, thick head. Grain aroma and grassy, hoppy notes.medium to high bofy,at first has s sweetness, after that some good bitterness. I like that pilsner!!"
"A clear, golden pour with white head.  The aroma has some light, grassy hops and surprisingly no skunk.  It has a light, somewhat thin body.  The taste is crisp and mildly bittersweet with lively carbonation.  It balances out nicely with a slightly bitter/mostly clean finish."
"12 oz. bottle from Total Wine, Chesapeake, VA (best before June 25, 2014). Yellowish-orange pour with a 1/2 inch thick off-white head. Aroma of pale malt, Earth, wet grass, and lemon zest. Taste offers moderate hop bitterness backed with a generous amount of malt sweetness for an overall balanced flavor and little that stand outs. Flavors are lemony citrus and sourdough. Finish is clean and crisp. Not my favorite style, but decent and one of the standards."
"Poured from a bottle.

This a funky tasting Pilsner. Bitter and a little skunky up front, sweet and grassy on the back end. Not my favorite style of beer, however, I nice change to try something different."
"Clear golden pour with lively carbonation forming pretty good, thick head that stays there. Malty aroma with some buttery, biscuity note and grassy, hoppy notes. Initially it’s biscuity sweet, then you can feel the spicy bitterness, and finally there is some honey aftertaste. Pretty average pilsner, I’d love to try the unfiltered version."
"Pours a clear gold color with white head. Slight hop aroma, with citrus and cereal on the palate. A decent pilsner."
"On tap. Pours golden yellow with slight white head. Aroma is malty, floral, bit. hoppy. Taste is medium sweet, medium bitter, hoppy, bread."
"Bottle, 50cl. Pours with a deep, golden, yet light to look at colour with a small, but stable off-white head. Lively carbonation releases as it settles in the glass. Malty, fruity and grassy nose with a biscuits thickness to its creamy honey sensation. Initially light sweet and grass malty pilsener taste, with the addition of spicy saaz hobs and lager yeast. Palate is very soft, delightful, balanced and just plain drinkable. Medium-full bodied for the type. Clean with light bitterness in the dry, spicy end. Hate when brewers claim to be the de facto standard of some beer type, but in this class... well,…"
"Pours a rich yellow color with a nice white head. The smell is light malt balanced by grass, crisp hoops. The taste is crisp, grass, light malt ending dry and a bit bitter. Light body with nice active carbonation. A classic."
"Unpasteurized freshly tapped in Zattl Restaurant in Vienna, dark gold with a lasting, thin, creamy white, frothy head. Smells of fresh malt, wheat and grain and fresh hops. Medium oily body. Tastes of sweet malt, bread and a grassy bitter hop finish. Refreshing. Some lingering grass and bitterness. Would be great with a good burger."
"Bronze colour, white head. Mild malt aroma, some honey and florals as well. Taste is mild, rich and sweet."

"Dress is golden blond. It has a peppery and fruity nose. In the mouth, it has a good presence, she seems a bit greasy. Its aromas are malty with a hint of honey. The finish is malty and houblonneux (herbaceous aromas). 
Pilsner Urquell is generous in every way."
"Can 0,50L. Clear golden colour with a finger of frothy white head. It’s the same beer as the one in bottle, but this one has no skunky smell, acctualy it has nice hoppy aroma of Saaz hops and some white brea malts. Bitter taste and aftertaste. Significantly better than the one from the bottle."
"One of my favourite pilseners.
Pours a clean, golden color, very decent carbonation. It is topped with a generous white foamy head, that slowly settles down to only a lacing around the egde.
The nose easily picks up pleasant malty and grainy aroma, a bit stronger than with some others.…"
Had at our bjcp meeting. Pours golden yellow. Light fleeting head. Some cooked corn. Fairly hoppy. Mild malt sweetness. Decent beer.
"Aroma of a German pils, but I liked the dry crisp, bitter taste. Nice drinkable brew. Orig rate 4/20/02...2.9. Now armed with some more beer knowledge I needed to revisit this classic. Skunky, grainy bohemian pils malt aroma. Medium bodied dark gold and mostly malt forward with the crisp dry pils experience. Hop flavor Is overshadowed by the caramel malt sweetness,  but it is assertive in hop bitterness.  Soft rounded palate compliments."
"Tap at many bar many times. Colour is clear golden with small white head. Aromas and flavours: Grain, some sweetness and malts. Definite chech pilsner."
"R8.Phonerating Draught @ some wine bar @ Embankment. This is a waste of time from the green bottles but on tap its way more soulful. In an Urquell pint mug it’s golden ..Powerful smack of rich malts honey hay straw toffee !.subtly hops are bitter and tangy, clean. Not had this draught in ages it’s a good pils not worthy of its hype status but shits on the bottle equivalent"

"How many times have I had this glorious pils and not rated it? Many times! Now’s the time! Colour...clear golden-straw with a thick white head. Nose...hoppy and honeyed with fruit and floral notes. Palate...instantly crisp, with hints of biscuit and honey comb, followed by jasmine and yeast. The mid palate is dry and the finish is exquisitely delightful!"
"Appearance was clear gold with pillow white creamy 1 finger head, no lacing. Aromas are fresh herbal spicy musky hops with slight corn pils malts. Taste are sweet pils malt upfront gives way to herbal, grass, musky locker room and slight spicy saaz hops. Palate was soft smooth CO2 with light body, then lasting herbal, spicy finish. A easy drinking pilsner brew, the standard."
"Bottle, pours golden with a white head. Tastes a little bitter with some notes of sweetness and spice. Okay beer."
A light aroma. It has a sweet delicately taste of malt mixed with a bitter and continuous hop.
Pours a nice clear golden colour with a healthy white head. Strong malty smell. Taste is malty initially with a mild bitter finish.
"Pours clear golden yellow, moderate off-white head with medium bubbles. Slightly skunky-hoppy aroma at first, giving way to grains. Medium body, crisp dry finish. Bitter, not sweet. Sort of mineral."
"bottle at a restaurant. one great pilsner! pale golden colour with a white head. floral grass hops, citrus, malts, more bitter finish, fruity and refreshing beer! nice!"

"My numbers for the draught version, which is by all means a great pils. A little dull to look at, but great aroma and taste, and indeed is the good average of all pilsners. As far as the bottled version goes, it’s below average and I wouldn’t recommend it unless it’s on sale. Many better bottled choices out there in the game of Pilsners, both Czech, German, Danish and Belgian. Go for the canned version or draught"

"Yellow golden pour with medium sized white foamy head. Typical malt and wet dog smell. Some hop in the distance. Wow, full malty flavour. Nice hoppy bitter to finish it off. Fuller body then I expected and perfect carbonation. Definitly one of the better pilsners I ever had. As far as I’m concerned, bring this beer to every bar/pub that I go to."
Pilsner Urquell is the reason I have a passion beer. I first tasted it in Prague 4 years back(very different taste then in the UK) The floral aroma is incredible with a decent with an outstanding after taste that lingers for hours after.
"Draft tasted recently in New York. I understand this is cold-shipped as are the bottles currently available in the U.S. It provides an interesting contrast to the fresh and excellent Urquell we get on draft and in cans in Toronto. The American one was very fresh with rich subtle tones of sweet bread and flowery hops. It is so good I wonder it it is unpasteurized. Nonetheless the one we get in Canada (pasteurized, I’d think) is as about as good, yet with differences I find hard to explicate. The U.S. imported one seems more winy (Riesling-like) perhaps, if that makes any sense. Either way, still t…"

Aroma of fat pilsner malts, floral bitter hops and light notes of earth and herbs. Similar flavor, mildly bitter, lightly sweet and spicy. Moderate body with a crisp, clean feel and a refreshing finish."
"Pours saffron yellow with a thin picket fence white crown. Aroma is a love supreme for pilsner: a floral bouquet. Taste is straight forward: cereal, bread, light sugar. You dont need me to tell you it’s classic & historic. The branding does that. A solid rock. And most struggle to beat it. So light, crisp & sessionable that it’d be a great drink -- or two -- before work."

Mainly bitter but with a nice malty sweetness shining through. Medium-thin bodied, almost creamy carbonation. Really good."

"Can. Solid classic pilsner. Grass, green wood, hops. Exactly what you should expect from a pilsner."
"Bottle. Pours a clear light golden color with a small foamy head that fades very slowly and leaves minor lacing. Aroma grain, grassy hops, and a light skunkiness. Taste is smooth sweet grainy malt with some nice grassy and spicy hops. The light skunky taste is what throws this off but I’m sure it’s because it’s shipped over seas in a green glass bottle. I bet this is amazing on tap in the Czech Republic."

Really delicious fresh which unfortunately, is pretty rare in the US. Don’t even bother with bottles…"

Theres also a subtle metallic touch to the aroma, and some lighter caramel and corn notes. Dry and distinct crisp palate with refreshing carbonation. Taste is similar to aroma with a dry grassy and light salty bitterness at mid-high levels. When it’s getting warmer there’s a rather unpleasant oily sweet corn like taste coming trough."
"Clear yellow color. Practically no head. Aroma of hops and some wine gum. Medium body, taste of hops with some bitterness."
(from notes) On Draft in Dusseldorf at Pilsner Urquell restaurant. Soft bready aroma. A truly floral and perfume-like hop nose. Some notes of wafflecone in the nose.

"12 oz bottle from a 6-pack given as a Christmas present. Pours a clear gold with a two finger bright white head that leaves a bit of sticky lacing. Aroma of biscuits, hay and corn. Taste is slightly hoppy with earthy/grassy hops, hay and corn and with a hint, (and I do mean a hint), of citrus and pine. Crisp. Light bodied, thin and watery texture, medium carbonation, quick and slightly bitter finish of caramel malts and earthy hops. Overall...eh. Pretty run of the mill pilsner. Not bad, but nothing that stands out about it."

Some floral hop character and a small amount of bitterness, just enough to give it that pilsner crispness. Has enough flavor so that it’s not boring but not so much that it becomes tiresome as a session beer. Leaves you feeling satisfied."
"The gold standard for pilsners. Clear golden amber, 1/2"" white head, thick bands of lace. Taste is clean malt that is quickly joined by floral hops; the two move smoothly through the palate, complimenting each other, to a brisk, cleansing finish. Solid, well-managed brew. Famous, and rightly so. Highly recommended."
"This is a very good pilsner. Color is perfect, aroma is nice and the taste is unique. When I recommend a good, light beer to my mass produced beer drinking buddies, this is one I suggest. And they usually drink this product and realize how good beer can really be compared to the mass marketed ones out there!! Great starting beer to transition to quality!"
"Draft, in a branded tankard. Burnished gold, white head that starts thick and recedes. Bready, malt, cereal, and an anonymous hop finish. Nice and bitter, but hard to pin down. Good beer."
"500ml bottle from supermarket in Budapest, clear yellow colour, large mostly diminishing frothy white head, fair lacing. Aroma is light grainy malts, heavy herbal hops and notes of butter and lime. Initial flavour is light acidic, turning into moderately bitter finish with an astringent feel. Medium body, dry mouthfeel, lively carbonation. Decent well hopped Czech pils, one of the better bulk light beers for sure."
"33cl at home , nice golden, hazy color , some hops smells with bread and toast , a nice soft beer that can recommend to people who drinking corporate lager"
"I had this at Global Brew. It pours gold with a white head. It has a bitter, hop taste. I thought this was pretty good. I would drink this again.

Nice to have a fresher pint rather than a skunky bottle!
Golden yellow with a nice moderate head, strong floral hoppy aroma and taste dominates, some malt in the background. Lively carbs, very refreshing... mild bitter finish. Love it! LF (Lagerboy Friendly)"
"Bottle. Crystal clear gold with a little off white head. Aroma is skunky, fruity and bready. Taste is toast with a fruity aftertaste. Palate is very smooth but could maybe use some more carbonation. Not bad."
at my home 0.50l bottle gold- blond colored body with a small white head and a slight spicy hoppy aroma a spicy hoppy bitter taste with a bitter finish
"The memories I have of this beer is a intense bitter flavor. I was not able to drink many of these. Its color is deep amber with a low coffee-malt smell. Also, it has a good body with a good carbonated foam. I think everybody knows this beer, so I won’t extend too much."
"Classic Czech diamond. I am not a fan of classic pale lagers, but this pilsner has a lot more to offer. Nice bitterness, nice hoppy aroma and very good taste. Highly recommended."

"Tapped at Kolkovna at the Eurovea shopping center in Bratislava. This is the best place to enojy this masterpiece in Bratislava/Slovakia. The Pilsner Urquell here is phenomenal! Fresh, spicy, malty, hoppy. The quality here equals the quality in Pilsen in the brewery. I know because I was in Pilsen not long ago so I can compare. I have been enjoying this masterpiece for many many years and hence it gets the maximum rating from me. It’s a masterpiece!"

"Tasted from draft. Pours a dark clear yellow with white head. Not too much aroma. Little straw aroma. Taste is mild sweetness up front followed by a small amount of bitterness. Effervescent and medium bodied. Very good for a pilsner. Probably the best I've had. Would love to taste it at the actual brewery since I heard its much better there. If you're a pilsner fan you should definitely give it a try.

"Pours an average white frothy head that mostly diminishes. Body is clear ""yellow and sparkling. Aroma contains malts (straw), hops (citrus fruits) and yeasts (dough, earth) and some fruits like cherry or forest fruits. Flavor starts off light acidic and finishes in bitter. Malts can be tasted in the ending. Body is thin and watery, carbonation is lively.
One of the better pilsners I had, soft in bitterness and quite heavy in the malts."
"Pour is a clear morning urine - like yellow, with a small, white and slightly fluffy head.
Aroma of wet straw, some sort of christmas-cookie kind of thing, slightly bread, and a weak herbal fell to it.

"pours light gold with white head. aroma of woody malts and citrus. taste is of mostly wood and bread malts with some floral. palate is crisp and full, perfect amount of carbonation. definitely is the standard pilsner."
"From 300 ml bottle. Pours a clear golden-amber with a small but quickly dissipating white head and lively carbonation. Aromas of noble hops, fresh cut grass, lemon zest and crackers. The taste starts out slightly sweet, before a moderate kick of hop bitterness comes though in the mid-palate. As expected, it finishes cleanly, leaving a zingy lemon aftertaste, although it fades fairly quickly. Very nice pilsner."
"0.5L bottle. Moldy, medium Czech hop aroma. Little false or to artifact seems this beer. Taste is to much sweet and sweetness gives caramel candy flavor which disturbs. Milky and fresh. Medium quality and taste."
"Hop. That’s what it’s all about. Yet, it’s very round and pleasent. Light gold color and white persistent foam."
"can. pours clear bright yellow with a nice white head, some retention and lacing. cereals, doughy but not sugary malts, grass, hay, hint of corn showing. average to moderate carbonation, light body - oily, grassy-spicy-citrusy finish. ok."
"Not a very good Pils but something I’ve come across a few times, light and easy to drink, cold and refreshing but not a ton of flavor"
"Bottle. Pours medium golden with a nice white head that dissipates quickly leaving just a ring of lace. Aromas of sweet grain, floral hops, and the euro skunk funk. The flavor is smooth and drinkable. Up front with sweet grain, bread, then finishing with a floral hop note and yeastiness. Nice but not really my thing."
"It is called the ""model of meter"" among beers. All other pilsners are a better or worse attempt to copy the original - the first ever Pilsner Urquell. Its unparalleled exceptionality is guaranteed by the same recipe dating from 1842."

A - bright golden with durable white head…"
Smells grassy and hoppy. Distinctly high end minus the skunk expected from green glass due to the new package. Appears dark almost orange gold. Small head quarter finger. This beer is delicious. Hoppy on top of the smoothness of the lager. This is just superior to other beers in this style.
Pint at Nicholson’s pub. Pale yellow colour with thin white head. Aroma is subtle hay and Nobel hop. Flavour is slightly corn popcorn hay and Nobel hop. Middle of the road on this one.
Light hay and cereal grain aroma. Pours a clear pale gold color with healthy head. Taste is mildly bitter and nothing else. Light watery body with lots of carbonation. I’s sure this is exactly how a Czech Pilsner is supposed to be but it’s just kind of boring on the plus side the light heavily carbonated body is really easy to drink.
"Can 500 ml. Light golden with nice white head. Malty, hayish aroma. Malty, dry hoppy taste. Overrated? I must re-rate one day.."
"Bottle. Pours clear light pale yellow with medium foamy white head. Aroma is malt, grass, straw, hay, flowers, grain and cereal. Taste is light bitter and faint sweet. Body is watery with good carbonation. Finish is short with notes of cereal and hay. Well balanced and refreshing."
"Bottle. The appearance is superb, very bright gold in colour very small head. The aroma is not very nice, a bit soapy. Bitter taste better than lager.

Tried this again on draught, what. A difference. Golden beer with medium head. Aroma of bready malts. Taste is bready malts, yeast and hops. Good stuff."

Pint at Courtney’s in Killarney. Ordered by accident as my brother in law was drinking Zlaty Bazant from the bottle and I thought it was Pilsner Urquell.

"Bottle poured a golden color with a ring of white head on the glass. Aroma has light bitterness, watery malt, grains, light sweetness, and muted hops. Mouth feel is light and the carbonation is most of where the mouth feel comes from. Flavor gets a bit of bitterness, old skunky hops, grains, and a lingering finish. Wish this were a lot more crisp."
"Can at home. The colour is clear dark straw colour with a huge off-white and bumpy head. The aroma has a nice touch of saaz, straw, wet hay and a pleasant sweet malt in the end. More straw in the flavour along with hops, and is a bit dry in the end. A well-balanced and rich classic."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a crystal clear golden color with a thin white head. Dissipates quickly leaving a foamy ring. Smells like a sac of skunky reefer. A bit thin. Taste of skunk. Some grass, wheat, honey, and some cereal. Refreshing. The skunk taste lingers on the finish."

"The original pilsner, what to say about it? It’s grainy and modestly hoppy. Nice, but it remains a pilsner, so it’s not that special."
Poured from glass bottle. Beautiful gold color. Honey on my nose. Weak head. Taste a bit sweet and slight bitter finish. Very refreshing. I would call it my favorite lager.
"Poured from can, brassy golden - much deeper than usual pils, white weak head. Grainy, a bit resinous, grassy aroma with some pleasant butterscotch and buckwheat-honey as well. Harsh bitter in taste and some sour because of carbonation is a touch too high. Medium body, oily texture and everlasting bitter dry finish - half an hour easily! Well, not impressive for beer of beers, should try it from tank in CZ."

Still--this is a pretty solid pils when it actually is fresh.  Grassy, sazz, fairly dry."

Very interesting aromas for a pilsner - butter, apples, toffee and a spice I couldn’t quite put my finger on (I think maybe cardamom?).

Delicate mouthfeel, soft on the palate.  Tangy tones and low yeast presence.

"Bitter and sweet, intensive taste. You can feel the very good quality of hopf and malt. It’s a caracteristic beer, so if it is not what you drink regularly, it can be too bitter."
"Honestly, I was expecting more from this beer.  Being the ""model of meter"", this beer is on the low end of the scale.   Skunky aroma, thin mouthfeel, watery taste.  Now, don’t get me wrong, this isn’t terrible, but it ain’t world class either.  This is an average beer, albeit over priced.  That being said, I may buy this again if I find myself on a beach resort in 90 degree weather and I need a buzz to deal with my sunburn.  It is light and refreshing."
"It’s everything it should be.  Pours clear and gold with a big frothy head and bubbles up bombing from the bottom.  Fell off to splotchy,soapy lace and a thin layer on top.  Smells like skunk.  Lemon underneath and pale malts with a touch of caramel and honey.  Earthy and musty with some pepper in the back.  Taste is crisp, clean, buttered bread and biscuit. Good malt sweetness and finishes with some earth and bitter for good measure.  It’s a touch metallic with a strong aftertaste.   Classic."
"The best pils you can get a nice foamy head with a real good taste better than all the rest

"This beer was great back in the pre craft beer era, but since then has been surpassed by the explosion of micro-breweries. That is why many people are disappointed when they first try it. Just enjoy it for what it is: a pioneer that has gotten long in the tooth."
"Definitely the litmus test for pilseners. It’s not the best, but it is consistent. In the bottle, you get a slightly metallic skunked off-flavor. It’s weak, but it’s present. On draft, that flavor isn’t noticeable. This beer, compared to American offerings, is not what I would call ""intensely hoppy"" (so says MillerCoors), but it finishes well, if slightly soft and sweet."
"The original pilsener, and an all-time classic beer. Smooth, drinkable, with the perfect hop bite in the finish. Not enough hops to assault your palate like an IPA - just enough to keep it interesting. Refreshing, light-bodied. The ultimate lawnmower beer."
Waited a while to try this beer but I’ve finally got around to it. I actually like it more than I’d expected. The aroma’s ok but the hop flavors are excellent. The watery body detracted from the beer overall.

Bottle @ Anette. One finger foam. Golden clear. Nutty aromas. Crisp. Fine dry lager. You cannot get a better classic lager. Rerated 1/4-13. Easter lunch
"From notes: Poured stereotypically clear golden amber with lots of bubbling and a 2-finger white head.  Grassy aroma, with some biscuity yeast and a touch of lemony citrus.  Body is light, with a crisp, dry finish.  Grassy, grainy flavor, with a touch of citrus underneath.  Not a huge pilsner fan, but this is the original, and it is done quite well."
"Bottle.  Pours crystal clear golden in colour, with nice big white head.  Unmistakeable Pilsner Urquell hop aroma.  Very drinkable."
"The best pilsener! Aroma of bread, hay and grass. Golden, a bit hazy colour, and white, smooth head. Almost a full body in pilsener terms. Quite bitter aftertaste. Had this one on keg in Prague."
"Bottle from Ocado; golden amber pour substantial white head, bready malt aroma with a hint of spice, sweet malt taste hoppy bready crisp refreshing."
Light golden hue and clean white head. Hoppy aroma. Refreshing light malt with bitter hops. An excellent representation of the style.
"Pours a clear golden brew with a médium sized white head with poor retention, aroma is moderate sweet and moderate to low with notes of grain and floral hops, médium to light bodied, flavors is moderate sweet and moderate bitter with notes of grain, bread crust and floral hops, good balance, simple."
"12oz bottle. Pours pale straw yellow with two fingers of white head. Aroma is bready, floral, with some hop presence. Taste is sweet malt with a crisp hoppy bite."
"Poured clear and amber/golden with a frothy white head. Aroma is restrained sweet malt and a little hoppiness. Medium, smooth body, flavour is refreshingly bitter and not overly carbonated."
Pours a pale yellow. Skunky pale scent. To be honest it reminds me of mass produced lagers and thus it turns me off a bit. The difference being it doesn’t taste watered down. Id relate it to a heineken. Easy to drink. Don’t like lagers and this one isn’t making me convert.
"Bottle. Pours golden, with white head that doesn’t last long. Aroma is relatively unspectacular, somewhat sweet with some hops for balance. Taste is caramel malt with some noble hops. Medium bodied, not too carbonated. Okay."
"1l 170th anniversary bottle. Nice and fresh one - brown bottle, so devoid of the skunky smell that usually pervades PU in green bottles, and really well kept. Just a classic bohemian pilsner - golden colour, reasonably big head, lovely Saaz hops smell complemented by bready malt and subtle buttery notes. Medium body, malty palate, quite strong hop bitterness with Saaz hoppy aftertaste. This PU was in great shape, really, just like the tankova version."
"Nice deep golden colour with rocky white head that lasts well, nose is heavily bread or cereal with restrained floral hop aromas in the background.  Lovely bready malt flavours take the lead, then zippy carbonation segways into a short semi dry finish as the hops take over.  Great refreshing beer and definitely a beer that could start and end the night."
"0,5l can. Aroma is malt and hops. Taste is mostly hops, grainy, and it is to bitter for my opinion."
"Nice pilsner. Grassy with a lovely sweetness followed by quite a bitter kick. It’s a good fresh session beer. Also you have to acknowledge their rich beer history and breakthroughs in pilsner beer making. They were first. So don’t say it tastes like other beers ... It’s the other beers tasting like this one ;) Also initiated the amber/ale beer making to counter the pilsner upcoming, not having the techniques and materials to copy it."
"It is not different from anothers of the same style. However, a little bit bitter than others from the same style. The color attracts more than the taste."
Not bad but overall this is a solid easy to drink pilsner. Nice on a summer day or at the park.
"On tap. Aroma of hay and grass, some citrus and malt. Taste is grainy, fairly sweet with relatively high bitterness."
"Aroma: grass and a little skunky; Appearance: golden, clear, small white head; light sweetness, medium bitterness; Palate: light body, thin feel, average carbonation, bitter finish;

"Relatively good, nothing special. Quite drinkable and pleasant, with a couple of friends."
"I know I love this beer, but I will try to rate it objectively after all these years and finally doing an actual rating. Rating is of a can in a pilsener glass. Aroma is wonderful, little bit floral. Appearance is great, solid deep yellow, bubbly, with a solid head. Taste is good, probably could do better than rate this from a can but it’s what I have. Nice balance of bitter and sweetness. Palate is great, smooth and drinkable with a nice bitter aftertaste that reminds you what you have here. Super beer!"
"Clear golden, white head. Sparkling. Sweet, fruity, yet very refreshing pilsener. Well-bodied, no way near as watery as most pilseners and nicely carbonated."
"Tastes like chiclets (the gum they sell at the Mexican boarder), or maybe like flowers, is it really green?"
"Just like the famoulsy-named beer from their neighbours in Czesky Budejowice, I tasted this beer for the first time as a drove with the family through the city of Plzeň. ""Well, sorry guys. We’ll have to stop here too, just one beer..."" Of course then it tasted to me like a nice, pleasant crisp ""Pilsener"", but perhaps I did not notice much of a difference between this and the mundane pilseners served in restaurants in Prague, but I have re-visited this lovely piece of history in a bottle. I think the head can be rather inconsistent, nice and creamy from the tap, and rather lazy from the bottle.…"
"500ml bottle served cool in a large tulip. Clear gold with a thin white head. Butterscotch aroma. Caramel malt flavour balanced by grassy hops. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, slightly oily mouthfeel, bitter finish. All-round good lager."

Update: so glad they are now packaging it, with the green bottles protected from light in the cardboard case.  It does indeed make a difference - no skunks evident!  Really, a great pilsner!"

It always a pleasure to sip this well brewed beer with so balanced taste world + very nice hop taste quarantees perfect sourness. If you are spending night with men and one of your friends has a sixpack of Pilsner Urquell and you have, let’s say newcastle brown ale, you just not have fun that night."

Pint can---> pilsner glass.  Pours a clear gold with a huge  thick pure white head that leaves a bit of lace.  Smells a bit grainy with a touch of sweet hop.  Nice non-offensive corn taste with a tad of hop bite.  Medium palate with good carbonation.  This does not suck.
"This was just 350 yen from a liquor shop near the Mina building in Kyoto. It was very smooth, crisp and hoppy. It is definitely the exemplar for the pilsner style. Refreshing!"
"PASTEURIZED well never seems to be fresh anymore(code date on back label is one year from bottling date). and after miller got ahold of them I think they enlarged facilities with stainless and stealing much of the house character. if miller wants to satisfy tastes, then way dont they leave it unpasteurized and unfiltered and refrig from the brewery to the local store. we will pay for the real stuff, fresh......but that would be in an alternate universe than the world we live in. Still the classic and pasteurized is still slighty better than Budvar(Czechvar) bottled in the same condition. TIP/…"
Pours light yellow with a white head leaving nice lacing. It has a strong aroma for a pilsener with a nice maltiness and aromatic hops. The taste has a nice balance between the maltiness and the hoppiness. Carbonation is medium. One of the best pilseners there is.
"Bottle from local grocery store, Norway. Pours deep golden with a thin head. Aroma is good and consists of bread and hops. Mouthfeel is medium to thin, but that’s normal for any pilsner. Flavour is quite sweet and malty at first, but leaves off with a pleasant hoppy aftertaste. Although macrobrewed pilsner isn’t exactly my first choice of beer, this is probably still as good as it gets."
"Draught @ Malostranska Pivnice. 
It’s a realy king of a Pils! Great balance, mouthfeel is a perfect. But there one thing - beer in a bottle and beer in the barrel/keg -- two big differences. You must to try from ’tanks’ only!"
Prior to this Pilsner my first pilsner ever was Krombacher.  As I said I was looking for that fragrance of grain and yeast and smell of bread.  I was surprised by the slight sweetness from Krombacher.  Urquell did not have that.  Both are on equal footing for the fragrances and smells.  I wish now I had saved a bottle of Krombacher for a side-by-side tasting especially for judging appearances. I liked Urquell off-white creamy head and fine bubles.…

I don’t know, but it inevitably has a funky, slightly sour flavor.  Jay brought me a bottle back from Czech, however, and my low opinion was immediately displaced.  This may be the best pilsner I’ve had.  Would love to try the ""ur""quell in Czech in the future."

"4-pack cans from Chuck’s @ $8.49. Really, what hasn’t been said about this beer already. Steeped in history and known as the original pilsner. Cans seem to be the way to go as I don’t have any of the oft-reported skunk. Strong hop profile and clean crisp carbonation. If you knew the state of beer in the mid-19th century you’d understand how it became so popular. Knowing what I do of 21-st century American beer tastes, I can see how it disappoints some."

This is one of my favorites. Golden crystal clear beer with refreshing herbal taste from Saaz hops. Taste is well balanced when drank from wide glass and much worse if drunk straight from bottle or can as in latter cases bitterness of hops will dominate everything.…
Taste is light Pils malt and spicy Saaz with a tiny bit of diacetyl that’s appropriate for the Czech style. Crisp and medium-light bodied. One of my favorites and I’m glad they just recently switched to the completely covered 6-pk boxes. I will be less afraid of buying it now.

"This beer pours as a clear, gold to light amber liquid with lots of bubbles and a minimal bubbly head. The aroma is of roasted hops and a bit of herbs, maybe grass. It smells like a Pilsner. The taste is strongly bitter with a long, mildly bitter aftertaste. I would call this a light bodied beer. It has a slick texture and is very effervescent in a way that reminds me of soda water. Overall this is a nice bubbly pilsner with the expected bitterness. I enjoyed this beer and would definitely drink it again even though pilsner isn’t my favorite beer type."

The ideal beer in my mind, even better with Cold Express shipment."

just a very flat, watery lager. wouldt drink it again. but respect that they still make the ’first lager beer’ glad to have tried it, but it aint rare, good tasting or anything it should have... i’d pass from now on"
"medium to heavy bitterness, bready, hoppy and bitter finish - bitter aftertaste that hangs on for a while."
"Solid foamy white head over crystal clear golden body with carbonation bubbling through. Aroma is malty, yeasty, doughy, with some hints of grassy hops. Tate is malt-forward, doughy, a little yeasty, with some straw, and a touch of lime. Palate refreshing and not too bitter. Highly drinkable."
"Golden, filtered body with lively carbonation, resulting in a pearl white, bubbly head. Malt-forwards aroma with a mild classic hop backup. Not sweet or grainy, but with moderate doughy feel. Very nice mouth feel, with small but active bubbles that spread the medium bitter taste in your mouth. A characterful beer that’s classic but never old fashioned. Well hopped. Okay, it’s not an Kvasnicový (this has less yeast and herbal aromas), but one of the very best pilsners I’ve had for sure. (50cl bottle)"
"Bottle 33 cl. A clear golden colour with a medium white head. An aroma of toasted malt, gras, hay, hops, flower and fruit. The taste is medium sweet. A medium body, thin texture, avarage carbonation and a light bitter finish."
Draught. Golden hazy beer with a minimal offwhite head. Fruity and hoppy aroma. Very hoppy flavour. Really nice beer :-)
"Decent beer that comes in very refreshing. Aromas of citrus fruits and apples, good kind of  bitterness."
An absolute classic. Pours dark golden with a bit more carbo than I like. But the aromas are doing their job. Some hops and citrus conbined with a very light bitterness. Good one.
"AROMA: A malt forward aroma - malt, spice, and floral hints present. APPEARANCE: A light golden pour with a creamy white, mostly lasting. Minimal lacing noted. TASTE: Complex malt flavors combined with a nice balance of hop bitterness. Also some hints of bread we're detected. Pleasing crisp bitter finish and aftertaste. MOUTHFEEL: Medium bodied and medium carbonation. OVERALL: I enjoyed this beer more this  time than I several months ago when I first tried it. Will buy again.…"
"Nice dark yellow colour, white head. Malty aroma with grassy notes from the hops. Bitter dry finish, lasting bitterness"
"can from Lcbo been a while since I last drank it. A: honey, floral App: clear blond small white head. T/p: Med body finishes on a bitter note of medium duration. Average carbonation. O: classic. super balance."
"Bottle. Clear dark golden pour with a foamy white head that quickly shrinks to surface cover. Nose is grassy and spicy with undertones of honey and lemon. Flavour is more grainy and malt dominated than the aroma but is pretty similar all the same. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy with lively carbonation and a lengthy bitter finish. Still a particularly fine beer; sharp and refreshing, it goes very well with food."
Sample from their big wood barrel at Stockholm Beer and Whisky festival 2011. Lasting fluffy white head. Clear yellow color. Some butter and much pilsner maltiness in the aroma. Huge bitterness for a Check pilsner but not in excess of whats nice. Clean taste and a  perfect body.
"Brought as can. Golden beer with a medium head. Smells of some orange there and pretty much yeast. Watery taste, nice bitterness though."
"Good Beer. Very much enjoyed the bite at the end, not to strong of a finish. Very enjoyable. Plus being the pilsner made where pilsners were invented its like enjoying a little history with every beer."
"0,5l bottle. A clear dark golden pilsener with white head. Soft hoppy aroma with notes of peach. Strong bitter taste of hops."
"Pours a clear orange yellow with a small white head.  aroma is of floral hops, grass, and some bready pilsner malts.  Taste is of spicy saaz hops with fresh cut grass notes, some bready malts, and some sweet malts.  Has a medium-light body with a semi creamy mouthfeel and a dry, semi bitter, spicy, refreshing finish.  overall, a nice, refreshin pilsner that is one of the best in the style."
"This is one of those sessional beers.  I can have one after the other.  Nice golden hue with a big soft white head.  Aromas are sweet malt, floral esters, with some apple fruit elements."
Bottle with my steak frittes dinner at The Standard Grill. Clear gold pour with standard white head. Grainy with corn sweetness and band-aid. The steak was better.
Delightful. The nose is earthy hops with herbal spice notes swirled with a light biscuit note. Brilliantly clear golden with a large frothy white head. Tastes of Saaz hops and light breadiness. Smooth crips and exceptionally drinkable.
"12oz bottle into a pint glass.

Pours a clear deep gold with a half finger white head.…"
Wonderful earthy mild hops hops with a spicy note. Good white lacing with a half inch of head. Golden transparent in color. Crisp aftertaste and very refreshing. I can see why everywhere else tries to copy the original pilsner.
"Extremely floral and mildly spicy nosefeel. Everything about this is supremely delicate, supremely soft... which works perfectly for a lager. Definitely one of the best lagers I’ve had. I now understand why they caught on way back when. Next time I’m with friends or family who only drink macrobrews, this is what I’ll share with them, no question."
"On tap at Flying Saucer on 7/21/2012.  Pours a clear golden yellow with a small foamy head.  Aroma is bread, yeast, and hops.  Taste is sweet and malty with yeast and a some hoppy bitterness."
"Poured clear pale yellow, with lots of bubbles and little head stayed.  Smelled of hops and bread.  Nice clean taste.  A lot of carbonation.  Not really my style, but great as pilsners go."
"On tap in Praque, nice head and lightly colored. The worlds first pilsner, not my style but had some taste, nothing outstanding. Rather light with a short finish. I will stay with my IPAs, porters and stouts."
On tap in Prague. Pours a golden yellow with a white head and malty aroma. Taste is of malt and caramel with a malty finish. Decent pilsner.
"Bottle-This beer has a flowery, spicy aroma and bitter finish balanced with a soft malt character."
"Aroma of corn, bread, and a sour yeast.  Pours amber with slight film.  Taste is slightly skunky with a great bready yeast and corn."
330 ml bottle pours golden with white head that fades to patches. Aroma is metallic and malty taste is buttery and metallic with a dry finish.
"Pours light, very little lacing. The aroma is very light. Tastes of malt and hops, with bitter aftertaste."
"On draught, shows a darkish caramel colour with a large head which soon faded. A strong tasting beer a little flat but a decent czech lager none the less."
"500ml bottle - clear golden body, thin white head that dissipated rather quickly. Crisp hop taste, bitter after taste. Nothing special."
"0,5l can. Golden body with a long lasting off-white head. A little bit malty but mostly flowery, hoppy aroma. Taste is smooth and hoppy. Very refreshing, very pleasant beer."
"Pours a golden yellow from the bottle, and a decent white head when poured into a pilsener glass, but little to no lacing. Aroma is light grain, corn, resin, and metal. Taste is light and ok, pretty much follows smell. Nothing to write home about, but something to offer to someone looking for something outside their normal macro box."
"12oz bottle.  Light in color.  Aroma of pale malts and light floral hops.  Average texture.  A decent beer for the style, but not the best beer."
"Medium gold, fluffy white head about 2 fingers high, slight lacing.  Lightly roasted Pilsner malt and Saaz in the nose.  Nice medium body, little salty. Clean crisp finish.  A benchmark beer."
Smooth and refreshing Czechoslovakia beer brewed the same since 1842. There is only one original.
Aroma is light hoppy with bread and bit nutty malt. Look is nice clear golden with frothy head that leaves lacing. Taste has more malt with good flavors of bread and nutd. Bit dry and bitter. Mediumbody and oily texture. Some butter. Not like the ones I dran in Prag but this is of course a classic among pilsners.
Good bitter taste. White foam stays for 3 minutes. Golden colour. Good pilsener but not the best.
"Glossy, sunset/fire-colored pour into Allagash flute from 500ml can. Thanks Andyfgt. Thick white head that kind of curdles and clumps as it fades. First 5 for appearance I’ve given in a long time. Weak, bland aroma that belies a fresh, bitter, bready flavor packed into a very light-bodied and drinkable pilsner. Can’t say I’m an expert on this (or any) style, but I like this."
Below average pilsner with a bitter aftertaste that i did not enjoy. Many other options that are significantly better.
"Picked up a sixer today, one of my goto pilsners.  Nothing really extraordinary, just satisfying.  Has a good dry malty flavor and a good balance of hops.  Very refreshing on a hot day.

Wouldn’t drink this beer again. Didn’t particularly like it and felt quite ill afterwards may have been off!
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a minimal head. Aromas of grass, yeast, and hops. Tastes like a pilsener seems like it should taste, and considering this is the original, that would be easy to say. Is it complex? Not really. But pilseners are meant to be refreshing, easy drinking beers and this is one that is all of that without being watered down or resembling anything from InBev or MillerCoors."
I imagine reputation gives this beer its high rating. Still a good beer though...grainy aromas...sweet grainy flavours. Smooth and refreshing.
"Fresh six pack (well, about as fresh as I can get) - picked up some fresh Bitburger and fresh Warsteiner today as well because it is so damn hot all I want to do is sit around in my underwear and drink crisp, light lagers all day - this beer pours a clear gold - quite an effervescent body - frothy, lasting head - nose of soft, lightly sweet maltiness, floral hops, a light mineral note - carbonation is soft in the mouth - flavor is dry, crackery, crisp, moderately bitter - just the slightest bit of honey sweetness underneath - but mostly crisp, dry and refreshing - man, I would love to get this fresh at the…"
"One of my favorite beers, Pilsner Urquel pours a beautiful gold with a white head and an aroma of fresh herbs.  It is deliciously hoppy and refreshing - not as hopped as an IPA, of course, but very crisp and clean.   When the brewery in Plzen changed from wooden vats to stainless steel, there was a flavor change; I prefered the old style, although it was not as consistent as it is now.  However, this is a great  beer, especially during warm, sunny, summer days."
Bottle to pint.  Looks fine; a translucent pilsner.  Smells decent; a little bitter and skunky (in a good way).  Tastes pretty good with a good mouthfeel.  Not too shabby.
Not bad beer btw in cz you can find better and cheapper.... is the reference beer for cz... but not the better
"Bottle from Sainsburys. Not bad for a pilsner, one of the nicer ones. There is a very nice flavour in there but I can’t put my finger on what it is."
"I see this is a popular pilsner, but I just didn’t like it all that much.  It wasn’t bad, but I never have to have another one.  It honestly was too much like a mass produced macro for me."
"500 ml can. Pours nice golden colour with quite a large white head that leaves a lacing. Aroma of grassy hops as dominant and sweet pale malt. Taste is bit cloying with sweet malt, hops and some honey. Medium bodied and lively carbonation. Malty finish. Quite decent pilsner."
Great beer for all occasions. Very light but flavourful. Good for sessions drinking!!!
Best beer ever. Czech republick has excelent beer. Pilsner is my favorit. Realy tasty.
"Had on tap and in bottle on many, many occasions. The classic pilsner. Golden colour, hoppy aroma, lovely white head. Massively bitter, bready and malty. For me, one of the best beers brewed by a mega-brewer (SABMiller in this case) in the world. A classic ""go to"" beer. Always enjoyable."
"The best beer of the world. I drink this beer everywhere, where I found it. The last in the Gran Canaria."
"500ml bottle. Aroma is hop, grass, citrus. Appearance is golden with a fine white head. Taste is light bitter and very light sour. Has a lively carbonation and a fine hopy finish. Overall a very good Pilsner. One of my favorites actually."
"On tan in Prague.
Golden color, good foam.
Some malty aromas and integrated hops.
Medium body & complexity.…"
"If this is a Pilsener what am I drinking through the years in Turkey? Some critics mention this beer as a soft drinking & balanced bitterness, I found more acidic and huge bitterness on the tongue. Colour is golden but not as bright as Budwieser Budvar.
A must have experience.."
Bottle. Pours clear copper with a finger of white head. Aroma is funky with a ton of bread. Taste is light and crisp with a hop bite. Solid pils.
"This is the first pilsner, which means it is also the first craft beer starting the beer revolution. It sits between Warsteiner as the more bitter and Weihenstephaner as the less bitter with its slight sweetness edging out the others. In these three, it’s maltiness stands alone as does its appearance - a deep gold. However, the nose goes to the Weihenstephaner."
"This is an old go to of mine.  Haven’t had for a while, but brings back good memories.  To me, this is the standard for a pilsner."
Light spicy hop aroma. Pilsener malt flavor with nice hop bitterness on the end. Decent.
"Bottle. People say this has been a great beer, but it didn't stand out for me. Poured golden color with lots of carbonation, which continued into the taste, too much I think. The smell was not pleasant for me.

Clear golden color with white head. Bitter beer from hops. it’s not bad. Has very high carbonation which stings in mouth. Solid beer.
"0,5l bottle and tap. Clear golden color. Not much of the head, really thin, medium lacing. Grassy, hay in aroma. Hoppy bitterness, slightly sweet taste."
"[keg at Anthony’s, Leeds] Clear golden pilsner, large foamy white head. I always get a fair amount of bready flavours from PU – not in the same way as a wheaty breadiness – more of a bitter, wet dough flavour (if that makes any sense). I also quite like the bitterness from the hops – it comes back with a decent crisp, dry aftertaste – as opposed to many other ’crisp’ lagers that fade into a sweet, syrupy mess [19052012]"
"Draught. Golden in colour. Buttery aroma. Nuts, grass, butter, bready malt, medium bitterness.

To be fair, I should rerate this from a bottle, as I suspect it deserves a higher rating."
"Fantastic tasty Czech pilsner. Strikingly strong hop bitterness and a nice crisp, dry and smooth malt flavors."
"A long time favorite. Works fine in a bar, at home, while eating, after sauna, at terrace etc."
"On tap @ Khao Thai Ottawa.  Pours a deep gold with a small white head.  Notes of mild skunk, bready.  Light body, average carbonation, mild hoppy finish.  Tastes were skunk, light caramel, mild hops.  A go to pilsner."

Aroma of wet grass and a very pleasant citrus from hops. Light rocky white head that did not stick around atop a golden amber liquid. Crisp clean taste. Medium mouth feel. Not bad wil drink again and re-rate"
"Pours a dark yellow with a short lived white head. Aroma is sweet malt and saaz hops. Taste is also lightly sweet with a nice bitey bitter finish. Mouthfeel is pleasantly soft. This is where it all started. It’s kind of hard to overstate how this beer gave birth to the most popular beer style in the world as well as Pale Lager and therefore embodies the image of beer itself. Yer the old Plzeňský Prazdroj is a lovely Pilsner and I guess it’s fair to say, THE pilsner."
Top of the market pilsener because of its full-bodied taste and texture.  Great nose too.
"On tap. Pours clear gold. Active white head, low carbonation. Aromas are straw, grass, little rotten apple. Soft and smooth balance. Flavour is very subdued slightly sour clean finish.  Pilsner aint my fave, but this is a good example of the style. Poured cold on a hot day, its refreshing.

"Clear copper colour, minimal head. Malty aroma. Smooth, light body. Very drinkable beer."
"Subtle notes of hay and herbs. Pale gold color with no foam. Bland flavor of oats and yeast/bread. Hardly any carbonation and extremely thin texture on the palate. Overall, a less than decent brew at best with hardly any flavor to it. I’d give this a D rating."
"Unfiltered from wooden cask, faintly hazy gold with a big fluffy cream head, peppery hop nose, malty and crisp, a little biscuit and golden fruit, not too gassy, a touch of something vegetal, bitter finish."

"Just an all around clean, crisp, spritzy lager with exemplifying portraits of fungus (white mushroom, khumb), spruce, yeast, and bread."
"Distinguished aroma, that of the typical Euro-lager; a scent that I can only describe as fresh running water with mild herbs, and  a slightly meaty taste (maybe cold roastbeef).  I enjoy the scent, but it is difficult to compare these Euro-lagers to anything else, as they have a unique aroma.  Appearance is clear dark-golden with a head that doesn’t last long.  The taste is bitter throughout with intermediate sourness striking at you and at times becoming dominant. Mouthfeel is thin with fizzy, but not unpleasant carbonation.  Overall this is another one of those brews that can assume…"
"Bottle poured into a Stella Chalice. Pours a clear gold with about a half finger of white head. Aroma is slightly sweet malt and a little earthy hops. Taste is about the same, being a little more hop-oriented and a slight skunk taste. Light-medium bodied with a somewhat thin texture. Lively carbonation and not as much of a finish as I hoped. Overall, not bad. Nothing here too special but drinkable nonetheless."
"slightly skunky, pale straw. notes of grass and light malt. bit of hops adds some crispness. solid pils."
"It's a classic for a reason. While I don't often look to Pilsners as my beer of choice, this one is a Pilsner I do enjoy. Pours a light straw with a thin head. Faint malt sweetness on the nose. Flavor is crisp and refreshing.

Clear golden colour with quite big head. Aroma is saaz hops.Spicy hoppy semi seet finish. Good pils!
"Bottle. Gold, medium white head. Floral hops and plenty of bready malt on the nose. There is real robustness to the sweet malty body balanced by long bitterness. Still exciting. [3.8] [1/12] Bottle. OK, still convincing. [3.6] 500ml can - never seen these before in Australia. Floral and lemony with the usual sweetness, touch of sourness and robustly bitter finish. Wowed by this all over again."
"This is the pilsner I copare all other Pilsners to.  Easy drinking, nice mix of sweetness from fruit and bitterness left on the tongue.  One of my favourite ""everyday"" beers."
"Bottle.  Clear golden brown like demerara sugar.  No head.  More aroma and taste than most of this style - initially bitter but becoming sweeter with hints of banana and marzipan.  Long, lightly bittersweet finish.  Crisp, clean, just the right amount of carbonation.  In summary this has a lot more character than most lagers."
"pours yellow/amber with frothy white head. aroma is floral and grassy, and this carries through in the taste. there is also good bitterness, and a fresh crispness, which makes it attractive on the palate. its one of the best examples i’ve tried."
"Golden pour with a medium white head. Faint hoppy smell. Slightly skunky taste with a bit of bittering hops. Had this brew several times on tap and bottle, but never seems to impress."
"Light hoppy scent, but stronger than most pilsners I have had.  Coppery yellow appearance, quite clear.  Taste is slightly malty and hoppy,  slightly bitter/sharp at the end of the sip.  Slight skunk flavor which fits with the flavors, much like in a moosehead.  Not bad, but does not live to the hype."
"I like the smell with this one. Nice and floral. I find this one awfully bitter, bordering on skunky. Nice color, but an acquired taste."
Golden colored pour. Big white head and tons of lacing. Rings of lacing actually. Big aroma of hops and a bit of malt tucked underneath. Taste is very malty and a nice flavor of hops and a slight bitterness. Very good. A constant in my fridge. Even better in the motherland.
"500 ml can from the LCBO. pours beautiful golden with a lovely white head. aromas of pilsner malts, lots of bready malts with some slight hops in the nose. the hops come through in the flavour and there is a really tight hop bitter finish. very nice pilsner."

Hops, hops, and hops, with a sneaky sweetness in mid palate, and a light bitterness in aftertaste. Crisp, clean, and dry. Refreshing and sublimely pleasant. Great pils."
"Pours a burnished gold, initially lively head suffering sudden collapse. Leafy, mulched hay, proofing-dough aroma teasing the beautifully balanced sweetness, slick diacetyl and quick hop bite that follows; sour-creamy with just enough spritz on the palate from the top of the glass to the bottom. Bonus points for availability; no pretenders to its crown as king of the supermarket and grotty offie pilsners."
Bottle on the meadows on a beautiful day in Spring. Lagery.  Pleasant grassy hops. A refreshing and satisfying experience.

Dark yellow without much head. Sweet mally nose and kind of a fat malty sweetness in the taste. Not much bitterness. Okay for a czech pils

"0,5l can from a Czech shop in Prague. Clear golden color with medim white head. Hay, grass and floral aroma with a bit resin of the Saaz hop. Huge malty aroma, but it’s in harmony with the bitterness of the hops. Very refreshing. Medium bitter taste, a bit like an ESB. Medium body with a small oily and creamy texture. Lively carbonation ang long bitter finish. Much bitter then a normal lager. A really good one, the original Pilsner."
"12oz bottle served in a pilsner glass. I got this fresh from a closed case so that the green bottle had not seen the light of day yet. The aroma is everything it should be, full of grassy hops with a sweet malt background and light graininess. Clear golden color with a fluffy white head that thinned but still left good lacing. The taste has got a sharp hoppy bite with just enough sweet malt to keep things in check. Light, crisp and refreshing it’s a fine example of the style."
"500ml can. Pours a golden yellow with a small white head that quickly dissipates with no lacing. Aroma is sweet malt, hops, and caramel. Yeast is bready and there are subtle notes of fruit.  Medium bodied oily texture with soft carbonation. I think I must have gotten a fresh can because this was fantastic!"
"Clear and pale golden color, with a large and fluffy white head.  Not especially aromatic, although some light malt and grassy hops come through.  Flavor is dominated by semi-sweet malt with some honey character, less present in the mix are biscuits and noble hops lending a pleasant crispness and low-moderate bitterness to help balance out the sweetness.  Tasty and quite drinkable, but a bit too sweet."

Aroma is surprisingly light with hay, some grassy hops, and grain. Flavour is somewhat crisp with grassy hops, butter, some hay and grain. Hops linger rather long in the aftertaste. A basic pils, where everything is under control. The diacetyl in the aftertaste does disturb a bit though."

"Golden with good carbonation, always small head retention, some malty aroma and flavor, some biterness, some honey, and dry finish. By the way, good body. Great beer."
"Unpasteurized bottle sample at a tasting at the Dancing Camel. Thanks beerandbeyond. Pours yellow to orange like with a small head, aroma of deep honey, carmel, nice acidity, herbs, butter, flavor of herbs, caramel, quite rich and refreshing, medium bodied.
From 50 Cl. bottle, bronze to amber color below a huge white head, aroma of citrus, yeast, marmalade and notes of flowers, flavor of malt, herbs and bitter finish, texture…"
"500ml bottle. Aroma of hops and spices with a good golden appearance, taste was also pleasing with sweetness and citrus flavours followed by a medium biterness. Good finish to a good beer."
Pour is hazy yellow with a large three-finger wide bubbly white head. Aroma is pretty faint but slightly on the sweet side with a hint of bitterness. Flavor is lightly bitter with a touch of hops in the aftertaste. Some notes of honey and czech hops. Highly carbonated.
"Light yellow with white and a good carbonation. Smells floral. Taste like freshness and has a thin but nice bitter finish. Nice, clean, simple and light. This is not bad."
"Sorry for the german rating, but this is a lousy rating from my ""newbie"" time (2007-2009), and it’s not worth of being translated. I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog!…"
Golden with a white ehad - malty aroma - good malt body that olso has a destinct hop bitterness - some bitterness in a lingering finish - nice
"I don’t understand the success of this beer. Definitely one of the worse czech pils, way too bitter..."
"Unpasteurized bottle sample at a tasting at the Dancing Camel. Thanks beerandbeyond. Pours clear golden with foam that quickly dissolves. Rich malty aroma with some honey sweetness. Bitter and Czech-hop mouth. Light body, soft carbonation dry finish - fresh and fun."
".5l can brought back to Belgrade from Prague. Glad to taste the real stuff, even if it is from a can. Nice balanced malty gold body with off white head that stays to play. Balanced but beautifully hop-forward and tart flower notes. Warm, juicy bittering throughout. Refined, and above all tasty. Lives up to expectations"
Very good for a pilsner. Hoppy and bitter. Prefer the draught version that comes without skunkiness
"Aroma I find to be very slight skunk with malt and toast. Taste is of slight malt with a nice hop kicker with a slight lemony citris taste and quite bitter on the palate. Bitter after taste, slightly sour as well. All around not too bad."
"50 cl can. Clear golden with small white head. Aroma is malt, straw, little bitter and hops. Flavour is malt, hops, little citrus, little butter, little sweet and a little bitter."
"golden of color with a white head. An aroma of hay, malt, butter and corn. A flavor of malt and hay, a light bitter finish."
"Bottle. Golden color and very lively carbonation. Medium head with medium duration. Aroma is dominated by hops and maybe a little fruit. Taste is mostly hops and bit too bitter for my taste. Rerated @ fonefan tasting. Medium head with medium duration. Color is golden. Aroma and taste are malt, hops and notes of butter."
Re-rate 1/24/12: Bottle sample at a tasting at Dancing Camel. Thanks beerandbeyond. UNPASTEURIZED. Clear golden. Buttery aroma with a bit of malt and a bit of grassy hops. A slightly buttery flavor with some sweetish malt and a nice bitter grassy hops finish. Medium-bodied. Not bad. 5/3/7/3/13=3…
"Pale dark yellow with good foamy head. Aromas, skunk, malt, hops and herbs. Good carbonation with crispy mouth feel. Aftertaste mildly bitter hops with off tastes common to Urquell and medium shirt dry finish. Good, however lately the diacetyl is off putting."
"Bottle. Orange bronze colour with lasting white head. Aroma of Saaz hops, skunk and some malt and sweetness. Hoppy flavour, some sweetness and slight copper notes. Really Dry finish."
"12 oz. bottle from Timer’s Liquor in the lovely city of Racine, WI.  Difficult to add to accolades this offering has not already earned.  Suffice to say it is one of the world’s best beers and you can use it as a guage to judge others if you want to.  I just drink it and love it.  Slightly hopped aroma upon opening the bottle, pours bronze, tastes bitter and sweet at same time.  Slight heaviness with mild hop tone upon finishing.  When on special, I buy.  Recently offered with nice pilsner glasses made in Germany, two glasses per 12 pack!  Geezus I wish they would’nt do that.  I had glasses and twelve…"
"Golden see through with white head. Watery texture. Aroma of hops and malts. lively carbonation. Finish has a sour bitter bite from hops. My respects to Plzen, but this is mediocre. Rerating Aug. 09. Lots of grain and grassy hops. Dry and crisp. Simple , tasty and well balanced Bohemian pils.From 2,9 to 3,2."
Pours golden with a thin white head that leaves decent lacing. Aroma was quite slinky to begin with but it faded to more maltiness. Taste was quite bitter with a hint of sweetness. Very dry finish.
"Pours a small white head. Nice aroma, very crisp. It’s quite dry, with a fizzy mouthfeel. Decent beer!"
sorry this beer sucks. skunky mc skunkster. medium oily bodied garbage. bleh.......
"Bottle. Strong skunk aroma. Very light malt sweetness, very strong hop taste for a pils. Overall, seemed to be overtly skunky, perhaps a bad bottle, but I have had this beer before and tends to be an excellent example of a pils."
"(bottle) clear pale yellow-golden colour with medium white head; floral and grassy aromas, clean and strong flavour with long medium bitter finish; still the best pilsner I have ever tried - no vague or watered down flavour and off flavours,"
"I refuse to give this a review. Rather , i will tell u this the pilsner the sets the bar for all pilsners."
Bottle. Clear golden colour with a small white head. Moderate hoppy aroma with malt. Light acidic and moderate bitter flavour.
"On tap at cerveceria internacional, seville, spain. Nice golden color.  Thin to medium smooth head. Nice smooth texture. Low to medium bitterness. Nice barley and cereal aroma. Good for a pils."
"Small and short-lasting head. Perfect refreshing-beer color. Very interesting, sweet taste and spice aftertaste. Could imagine drink a half-dozen ice cold after mowing the lawn on the hit day.

"Bottle - average size foamy head, medium copper color, sweet malt aroma and flavor with a mild dry aftertaste"
"Medium hazy brown. Only a little head. Mild spicy apple like aroma and taste. Clean sweet finish. Enjoyable. 

---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
"Not a whole lot of flavour here, but I enjoy this okay. It’s refreshing on a hot day."
Light golden and clear color with medium sized head. Fine pilsner aroma. Good easy drinkable lager. As only the Czechs can make them.
"Tap at red squirrel. Aroma of hay, cut grass, bready yeast. Similar tastes. Not really my idea of a good time"
"First golden lager ever and still the best beer there is. Color is golden, smell is creamy and you can smell the hops. The taste is quenching with a good bitterness which makes you want to have another sip of the beer. This is quality!"
"0.33 l bottle, from supermarket. Draught, @ Gin Factory Bucharest.
Clear amber colour.
Light sweet with a bitter finish.
Good Pils!"
"33 cl. bottle @ home. Pours pale gold with a big white  frothy head. A lot of hops in the taste. slighty bitter as a good pilsener should be. light dry finish leaving you wanting for more,"
The embodiment of plisners...refreshin taste...unigue subtle aftertaste...nice hoppy aroma with a good balance between sweet and bitter...golden almost amber colour
"Bottle in a weizen glass. Pours light gold with little white head. Hoppy And yeasty. Bitter start and finish, but mild. Light body. Easy to drink. Reminds me of kronenbourg. Tasted like what I thought it would. Burpy."
I have fond memories drinking this in a liter glass in Prague. It isn’t anything particular special if not attached to memories though. It is the founder of its style and deserves credit for that.
"For those of you who have tried this from the bottle, it is unfortunately several grades below the beer that comes from a good keg in a Czech beer hall that has been tapped for only a few hours, not to mention the non-pasteurized version that you can get directly at the brewpub in Pilsen.…"
"pours a nice amber color keeps the head for a long time.  It has a rather bitter after taste although it is not the taste of hops.  All in all, I didn’t particularly care for this brew"
"33cl bottle. Pours a clear betwin golden and amber. Medium white head. Nose : Light aromas of basement, cereal and a bit caramel notes. Small floral honey. From nose it seams it’s gonna be more malty then hoppy. Sip : Oily with a little carbonation which I find surprising. A bit smoky too, I could compare to English pale ales. Small citrus and long little bitter hoppy aftertaste. Overall : I must say that for a pils it’s a really nice one. Truly surprising body and more complex aromas then a regular pils."
"500 ml bottle poured into a pint glass. The beer pours a clear light amber with a very thin white head. Aroma of a slight biscuity sweetness, dominated by a grassy aroma. Taste has an light underlying sweetness, but is once again dominated by a medium bitterness of the hops. Light and fairly lively in the mouth, it finishes with a long bitterness. This is something I would drink every so often."
500ml bottle from cant remember. great stuff here will be returning for more
"Doesn’t do it for me - not as distinctive as peroni and doesn’t have the spice character that I like about other pilsners

---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Very good pilsner. A little too sweet for my taste. Reminds me of Beck’s but much smoother. Highly recommended.
"Finally got myself to rate this classic at a nice summer BBQ. The aroma is grassy-lemony and hay-like, unfortunatley a bit skunked already, although I bought it pretty fresh. Fine deep golden appearance with a vanishing head. The flavour is again hoppy/lemony, even a bit fruity and resinous with classic pale malts - hay and bread. Lingering, dry finish. 

 Update: Great pilsner, especially when sampled next to more mediocre examples of…"
12 oz bottle west end taste is bubbly and effervescent not bad could be refreshing on a hot day
Simple plain pilsner. Not much difference with its more popular cousin Miller
"Pours golden and sports a nice fluffy head that fades quick to a film.  Nose brings sweet malts, earthy and somewhat floral hops and almost a rich caramel like malt sweetness.  Flavor is a good balance of malt and earthy and floral hops.  Mouthfeel is smooth and full.  Medium carbonation and mild bitterness keep it easy drinking.  Pretty nice but I enjoy other versions better."
"Nice amber/gold color; Medium creamy body; Aroma of floral hops, & grain; Flavor of malt, hops, grain, and some citrus; Finish is slightly bitter; Nicely balanced; Overall, solid pilsner."
"Draught sample @ 3 Små Rum on November 10. Pours pale golden with a small white head. smell is very subtle with some bread and butterscotch. Taste is also subtle with butterscotch, sourdough bread and a slight fruitiness that reminds me of mana´darin oranges. Very drinkable but also rather dull."
"Bottle dated March 2012. Fresh, gentle hops and crisp malts in the nose hinting at greatness to come. The appearance is typical of pilsners. Disappointingly, the palate was weak and undercarbonated, and the taste notes very shy, with only a bit of lingering hop bitterness. I am positive this is all due to the age of the bottle; I’d like to have a fresher one that could deliver all the promises made by the enticing aroma. For now, though, the most complimentary I can be about this beer is that there is none of that industrial, metallic taste of Western macros."
"Nearly perfect, and I find myself rating this highly out of respect and a genuine liking for this brew.  The crispness and freshness is always present whether warm or cold.  Hard to think of anything in its class that is better."
"After trying many pilsner-style brews lately, I agree that this one really does set the standard. It’s light, crisp, flavorful, and has a full-bodied mouthfeel that belies its low alcohol content. Aroma is grainy and spicy. Taste is hoppy. Finish is dry and pleasant. Go Czech!"
Bottle to pint glass. Pours clear straw gold with a soapy white head that fades to a film with good lacing. Aroma is skunk and malty straw and wet grains. Taste is sweet malt grassy and finishes hoppy and bitter. Palate is thin and crisp with a chaulky finish. Easy drinker!
Clear blonde with thick white head and gentle hop aroma. Bitter at first with prickly carbonation but becomes gentler creamy malt
"500ml can. Had this ages ago in a green bottle and it had gone totally to skunk. I avoided it for years until a friend insisted it was good. Normally, I favour bottles over cans but in this case can was definitely the way to go. Poured a deep gold with good foamy white head. Not a strong smell, but some light malts and hops come across. No skunk in this one. Taste was surprisingly hopsy, with some good malt balance. Palate was crisp and clean. Overall, a very good pils with enough hops to make it interesting."
"12 oz bottle.  Pours a clear, light golden color with nice pearly head.  Aroma is hay and dough notes.  Flavor is very light and crisp.  Palate is also very light.  What a classic.  I could drink these all day."
"500mL can from LCBO.  Pours golden yellow.  Aroma has pale malt and some hops.  Taste is syrupy and bitter, with some alcohol in the finish.  Better than the average pilsener."
"A bit of malts and a bit of yeast in the taste, but with the hops coming out on top of them. A yeasty, buttery aroma. Clear light amber colour, minimal white head. Rich and complex in taste for the style, however it doesn’t exactly cater to my taste buds, nor to my aromatic preferences. (Bottle)"
"The one and only - on tap from a tank that is (and only in Prague, Pilsen and Brno). Had quite some years on this one ... definitely the best of the mass production.Love this beer and it’s bitter taste which I can’t find in any other beer. Bottled and canned isn’t that awesome."
Pours translucent gold small quickly disappearing head. Aroma typical of pilsner. Smooth going down with a sudden bitterness at the end but not overpowering

"Tasted from bottle into lager glass. Transparent golden color with creamy, long-lasting head. Very light color and body but nonetheless complex. Noble Saaz hops yield a wonderful subtle spice. Nice round mouthfeel, not overly carbonated. Soft and spritzy. The first and foremost of pilsners, against which all others are measured."
"Bottle 33cl. Amber colour with off-white head that dissapears quickly. Aroma is malted, herbal, cereal, floral hopped. Taste is medium bitterness. On palate results a medium body beer, with good carbonation. Final is bitter. A very enjoyable beer."
"Date: September 24, 2011 Mode: Bottle Source: Minneapolis Beer Fest.  Full description not available as I sampled way too many beers in 4.5 hours!"

Taste is initially sweet as well. Malty fruity with a dose of hops.…"
"A word to the wise … be leery of clear or green colored bottles!! Reason being is that they let a lot of sunlight in and if not properly stored that sunlight will skunk up a beer fast! And I think that is exactly what happened to this one! In order for me to better review this brew, I’m going to have to go to Czechoslovakia myself and try it there as fresh as I can get it!  This brew poured up a crystal clear light golden colored body with a thin foamy head that quickly dissipated and left negligible lacing. Immediately upon opening I could have sworn I could reach in and pull out that skunk by the tail!  (This…"
"On tap at Beermarket in Toronto.  Pours deep golden hue with a thick white head.  Nose is herbal hops and biscuit malt.  Medium, very crisp body.  A lot of herbal hops balanced on the pallet by biscuit malt.  Long bitter finish.  Outstanding, classic brew."
The Gold standard in pilsners.  Especially good when drunk in the czech republic where it seems to taste extra smooth.  I wish more places in the uk served it.  A great looking clear Pilsner with a clean smell that just makes me feel good and refreshed.
"Pours golden with a head that quickly disappears. Aroma of cereal, hops. Taste is a mix of hops, bitter, spicy, malts, slight herb. Medium body, crisp, good carbonation. Nice intro to Bohemian Pilsner but its still a lager."
"Bottle.  Aroma is slight cereal, wet hay, and hops.   Pour is lite golden with white head. Taste is""classic"" pilsner, some cereal, barley, and good hops on finish.  All in all a quality beer."

"12 oz. bottle. Pours a clear yellow with a small off-white head. The aroma is cut grass and earthy hops. The flavor is sweet up front, with a sour and bitter note rising in the finish. The palate is light to medium and crisp. Overall, this is a fair beer. Good mouthfeel, but an unpleasant flavor."
Haven’t had this one since the 90s.  I think the last time I had it it was skunky.  I made sure to carefully select this one from a case so it would have minimal light damage.  No skunky taste at all.  Very drinkable and not nearly as bitter as most pilsners seem to be these days.…
"Tasted 9/3/11. 12oz bottle. JAN1112 21:47. Pours filtered and golden hued. A shade lighter than the Czechvar I had right before. Moldy white head. Aromas of cereal grains, but no trace of a hop profile in the olfactory. Medium bodied and a more rounded effervescence than the Czechvar. It has a nice, dry body to it, but it also comes with a bit of diactyl. Mildly sticky with a decent punch of grassy hops. A lingering astringency mingles with the carbonation and the hops to add to the palate and flavor profile. Solid, but from what I just experimented, Czechvar wins."
"Can  500ml. Pours light golden color, high foam that disappears quickly. One of the classics in Czech beers."
"Poured clear gold in a lager glass with some head and some lacing from the green bottle.Grainy sweet aroma,some skunk soft light hops.Smooth taste slick mouthfeel easy to drink,very mild sweetnes kinda grainy,with a blancing light sour apple bitterness,finishes mildly bitter that lasts, pretty good i would like to try this from a can."
"Original Rate 08.01.2008, Re-Rate 08.24.2011. From 3.2 to 3.3. Pours rose gold with a thin sparkling white head that lasts through the glass. Aroma of fresh cut hay, sweet and hearty, floral and spicy hops. Flavor is floral and spicy hops along with some playfully sweet malt and toast, some grassiness, a little dry rooibos tea in the aftertaste then lightly bitter, spicy hops. Nice, dry mineral water and hop fade. Very refreshing with just the right amount of carbonation and light enough to be a great summer brew. Only buy if you believe it hasn’t been on the shelf too long though,…"
"Can, 50 cl: Clear golden beer with a minimal white head. Inviting malty and floral aroma: Hints of bread, hay, little caramel and grass. Taste is fruity, light sweet and medium bitter with a dry, hoppy finish. Light in body, oily texture, average carbonation. Not exceptional, but the high drinkability makes this one a classic."
"a good Pilsner,  but that’s what you’d expect.
solid dark gold colour wirh a good foamy head. aroma is biscuit and bread.  initial sweetness on the tongue then dancing carbonation alongside more biscuit and a good malt and hop bitterness to finish.
not really my choice of drink but probably usful on a summer afternoon."
"Light grain, bready/cracker aroma. Saaz hops jump out with a slight spicy/perfume aroma. Excellent clarity and white head. Flavor displays a solid maltiness rounded by a hoppy bitterness. Bit spicy, subtle diacetyl notes. Get somewhat of a dry skunky aftertaste.  Medium body, medium carbonation, also a bit astringent due to the bitterness."
"Draft at Hendricks. Pours a golden colour with a decent white head. Aroma of yeast, barley, grassy hops and caramel. Similar flavours with moderate bitterness and a grassy hop linger. Quite refreshing. A very good example of the style. Moderate carbonation with a light CO2 prickle."
"Aroma is cereal and straw. Medium body with high carbonation, nice creamy then crisp palate, slight lemon rind, fresh grass, and dry hoppy finish. A classic."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grass and bread with a little bit of citrus mixed in. The flavor has a little bit of bitterness from the hops, as well as some bready malt. I also get a little bit of spice from the hops which mixes very well with the other components. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Can, BBE 01.01.12. Clear golden colour with thick white head. Great grassy hoppy aroma. Sweet malty and bitterly hoppy taste. Great balance and so refreshing, it’s a true classic!"
"Tasted on 8/8/11 from a 12oz bottle purchased at Lush Roscoe.  Pours clear golden with an average, bubbly white head that recedes rather quickly to a bit of spotty lace.  The nose is lightly fruity with bread, hay, and cereal malt, and some underlying spicy hops aroma.  The flavor is fairly light, starting off with the hay and bread malt, moving to the spicy hops, and the lightly sweet fruity flavor and caramel malt.  The body is light with lively carbonation and a long spicy hops and caramel malt finish."
"Well I don’t like Pilsners too much but this one is not bad. A little earthy, very grainy."
"Can LCBO Pours light golden clear with a medium white head. Floral aroma of hops. Medium bodied with medium carbonation, pleasant. Some initial sweetness with a bitter finish. Quite refreshing on a summer’s night."
On a hot day in Prague this tastes really good when served draught in a public house. Saying that I have had it in bottle form and it doesnt come close to how good it tastes on draught in the Czech republic.

A really awesome beer will buy again for sure great taste so much better than I thought it would be thumbs up
"Well, this IS the original pilsner, so since I like the bitterness a lot I am not going to rate this quality pilsner low, but since I personally like the Budweiser budvar mix of bitterness and sweetness a bit more I give this a 4.9/5.0 instead of a full 5/5.

Ohh and btw, this pilsner benefits from being served cold a bit more than most…"
On tap at Sunset Grill at Allston MA. Clear yellow thick white bubbly head. Nose of hops. Taste is flowery bitter hop grain. Reminds me of an old lady’s potpourri bathroom.  I wouldn’t drink again.. glad it was only a taster. Shared with AirForceHops.
"Recently had the export version, but drank the ""original"" last year in prague. Quite a difference... Too bad. Clear golden colour, white head. Aroma of hops and grains. Taste is fresh, quite hoppy, cereal and a bit like iron. Liked the czech version better."
"Clear golden colour, carbonation, average white head, fresh aroma of hops, some malts. Crispy taste, smouth finish, one of the better pilseners"
"12 oz. bottle. Pours golden with a white head. Quite enjoyable with a nice balanced aroma, and a decent bitter finish. Cheers!"
"Not my preferred style, but decent for not an IPA. I always like that little sour note."
"In my opinion this defines the perfect Pilsner. It has, in my opinion, all the qualities you look for. A perfect balance of hop and malt, beautiful color, and nice aroma. It defines the style for me."
"little to no skunk taste.  grassy bitter finish.  looks just like you would expect it to.  actually leaves a small bit of lacing.  the head kinda stays around the edges with a little film on top.  while alot of pilsners have a kind of ripe banana smell, this one has a more earthy smell.  not so sweet.  the mouthfeel is creamy carbonation and refreshing at the same time.  they say this is the true definition of pilsner.. i get that.  wish it had a little more abv.  but this six pack will be gone in a few hours so i might be happy for it in the morning.  real good beer.  I’m going to buy another czech beer soon.  Got me…"
"On tap at places throughout Prague. So much better than the bottles in America. Crisp fresh balance of bready malt and leafy pils hops. A delight, especially considering the Prague drinking atmosphere."
"Clear gold, frothy white head. Aroma of cereal grain, apple, I’m missing that light struck hop that you get in the bottle since this was a keg. Taste of cereal grain, corn, apple, mild bitter finish. Medium light body, medium high carbonation."
"A very good pilsner.Bottle is very appealing,Enticing smell.A bit bitter.Over all worth the 11.99 for the 6 pack"
"12oz bottle.  The first good Pilsner I really appreciated, for sure.  Filered peach tan.  Thin, white head, soda like carbonation.  Bready, light to medium body.  Solid noble hop presence.  Exceptional Pils, fresher the better.  Doughy, smooth, incredibly sessionable but still shows a lot of character.  Simple and straightforward in some respects, but World Class all the way."
"Really solid beer.  Has a nice full, rich flavor, good hoppiness as well.  Finishes crisp and clean, tasty"
This really is the perfect pilsener. Many of my North American friends do not like its full body taste however.
"500ml can, Hungary. Nice hoppy smell, hoppy taste with some earth note. Oily finish, medium body, low Co2. A very little roasty aroma i can feel from this beer."

Bottle. Pours light with white foam. Smells lightly sweet with hints of resin. Tastes lightly bitter with hints of lightly toasted barley.
"On tap @ Cafe Amsterdam. Clear deep yellow with a big fluffy white head. Aroma of spicy, herbal noble hops with some light malt and grass. Flavor is mild bready malt with a very clean hop bitterness. Light body with lively carbonation and a crisp, refreshing finish. I’ve had old light struck bottles of this before and didn’t think it was that great but fresh on tap this thing is excellent."
"Poured a clear golden, with almost two fingers of head which quickly dissipated. Aroma is is earthy, grassy and even a bit nutty. The taste has a mixture of pine, grass, some sweet bread tasting malts on the aftertaste. There are also some hints of nuts and dough that linger. Nothing spectatular, but certainly a decent traditional pilsener."
Nothing at all wrong with this. Very refreshing beer with some very light maltyness backed up by a very significant bitter bite at the end. Could drink this all day long and never get sick of it.
Pours a straw colour with an average white head. Yeast and spice aroma. Sweet initially with a bitter aftertaste. Good example of the style.
"Excellent lager, really enjoyed it, one of the best I have had recently. Great colour, pours well from the glass, tastes great, can’t ask for more."

"The original Pilsner.  Very drinkable with that classic ""urine"" aroma.  Nothing too over powering here.  It would go great with just about any food."
Pours a straw colour with an average white head.  Yeast and spice aroma.  Sweet initially with a bitter aftertaste.  Good example of the style.
"Excellent with kielbasa and rye bread and other beer foods, this beer pours a bright golden yellow with an oily pearly white head.  It is very bubbly.  Smells of hops.  Goes down nicely with a slightly bitter aftertaste.  Not my favorite beer, and may not be perfect by itself, but good with food and for the pure novelty of drinking the original pilsner."
"Bottle from Mane Liquor. A fantastic pilsner. Slightly spicey, slightly peppery. Great drinkability and decent mouthfeel. Nice"
"can poured into weizen glass. Clear golden pour, classic appearance. Aroma and taste are much stronger than typical german pilsner. Malt and hops, grass, metallic, a bit of citrus. Fantastic creamy mouthfeel. Refreshing, crisp, an excellent pilsner. Can is infinitely better than the skunky green bottle."
"Pilsener Urquell. I got curious after hearing a lot of good things about, so I found myself a bottle and a glass. It poured nice into the flute like Urquell glass and formed a decent head. Aroma has pepper, yeast and a hint of lemon. Taste was bitter with a sweet side on it. First two sips were awfull, then it grew on me and I started to like it. Too bad the taste is too vague to last long in your mouth"
"This was OK. It works if you want a refreshing beer, I guess. I can’t have a lot of this, however, it turns a bit boring after the first pint. Good for the style."
"From a can. Pours a dark golden color, close to an amber with a decent, thin head. Smell is spicy and earthy with hints of lime. Taste is very sweet with a clean, malty backbone and lots of biscuit. Finishes crisp and dry. Much better than the bottled variation."
"500 mL can purchased from the LCBO in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. First tried this beer about 8 years ago and have enjoyed it periodically since then. Pours a dark gold with a soapy head. Interesting and more pronounced aroma than most other examples of the style, particularly compared to your typical German pils. Fruity with a dry finish. Enjoyable but it doesn’t seem as complex as it used to be."
"Clear golden fizzy body with white head, light citric aroma, nice bittersweet flavour. A very nice pilsener."
"Excellent pilsner.  This beer always wins awards at beer tastings.  Worth trying at least once.  A fine smooth, clean, crisp pilsner beer."
"The first is still good. Light golden colour, with no real head. Crisp clean finish. Tastes like what other beers wish they were."
One of the best lager in the world. Such a fresh and complex taste and finish. Simply amazing!
"O yeah! This is quality. Very simple and smooth and very refreshing just like all those beer commercials say, but this one is for real."

Bright golden pour with small head. Grassy aroma with hops present. Nice crisp taste of hops. Refreshing beer on a hot day.
"0.5 bottle on a ferry to Tallinn, soft flavor with lasting bitterness, drinkable pils"
"Drank it in Prague at U Kocourna...like no other beer on earth when its fresh. tastes like youre eating hops its so fresh and forget any American IPA, this has to be one of the hoppiest beers on earth but not overpowering or unbalanced. Unfortunately I have not had a single one in the USA that tasted like this. All imported bottles are skunky. Try it on tap at a bar with a reputable publican."
"Bottle. Pours a bright golden, thin white head. Fairly strong, inviting aroma for a pilsner. Floral, grass, and some fruit come through. The taste is ok. Its smooth and crisp. Long bitter palate. Overall drinkable but not a huge fan."
12 ounce bottle.  yellow with a nice white head.  Perfect example of the style.  Drinkable and refreshing.
"Appearance:  clear light gold, one-finger white bubbly head, a little bit of lacing.   Aroma: good blast of peppery saaz hops, some grass and hay, slightly sweet buttery crackers.   Taste:  white pepper, hops, grains, toasted farmhouse bread.  Finish: crisp, clean and dry.   Notes: 	A fine example of the style.  Palate is light and crisp, flavors are decently balanced."
"12oz green bottle, pours with a white head, fluffy, aroma is a bit of skunk, a bit of citrus, the beer has been slightly contaminated with skunk, but I’m getting a bit of nice earthiness to it. Not too bad. Drinkable and enjoyable."
"Reviewed from notes.

Pours a moderate yellow straw color with a white head and a bit of lacing. The nose is slightly grainy and a bit of hops. The taste is slightly hoppy with some grain and straw. Light and crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this drinks pretty well, and I’ll always have a soft…"
Bottle. Pours a sparkling light straw with rocky white head. Suble aromas of noble hop and bready malt. Flavours show some malt sweetness nicely balanced by hop bitterness. Great beer.
"pours a golden color with a white head. Smell: saazhop and malts. Taste is soft, with hints of vanila and a soft well balanced bitterness in the end."
"Overall pretty bland but drinkable. Its not really that special in my opinion. Definitely something different if you want some green (non-twist off) bottles. Homebrewers beware there is a plastic label near the bottom that takes some scrubbing to get off, unlike the paper label type. Average beer at best, C+."
"Bottle on 04/03/2011. Clear golden body with a medium fizzy white head, Sweet pils malt and grassy hop aroma. Dry grassy flavor, with pils malt and very crisp bitter finish. Medium light body with moderately high carbonation. 7/2/6/4/14 - 3.3

"A fantastic Pilsner,just as strong as I like it, and with a refreshing taste-the best pilsner i’ve ever tasted, with an amazing palate, quite bitter-acidy taste and a perfect head.Great beer..."
"Well, chalk this one up to ""how in the Christ haven’t I rated this yet?"", Nearly 1100 ratings and I’m getting to Pil Urquell NOW?!?!?! Wow. Poured from a can, because fuck you and your green glass too. Pours crystal-clear honey-gold, with an orange hue. 2-finger white head is nice and rocky, but not the most persistent, the skim does stick around for a while though. Lacing is spotty to quite good. Nose is spicy, funky, earth and noble hops, a scratch of butter, and a whiff of corn. Smells lovely, but I wasn’t expecting the light butter aroma. Flavours are wonderfully earthy and nutty, some lig…"
"Bottle.  Okay, this here is a very fine pilsner! Aroma is pretty weak, a bit of a sulfur or some other odd smell to it.  Tastes a bit slick, with a decent taste and body to it.  Minimal aftertaste, not strong but does linger in the back of the mouth.  It’s overall pretty crisp and I’d recommend it, although Pilsners aren’t really my thing.  I could drink a dozen of these in a row though!  4.4% alcohol."
"While this is not my favorite beer style, this particular beer is a fine pilsner representation. Pours with the clear light golden color so characteristic of the pilsner style, giving way to an impressive two-figure head. The lacing is not particularly impressive, but sufficient nonetheless. The aroma is somewhat yeasty, with hints of candy. The light mouthfeel is accompanied by a pretty sweet taste that transitions to a very mild bitterness in the finish. Overall, it’s very mild and refreshing, but nothing too terribly exciting."
"20 oz draft pours a clear golden yellow with a nice white head. Aroma grassy, biscuit  and very faint floral hops. Very crisp and simple, very easy to drink"
"Compared to Heineken, Carlsberg and original Budjedovice this is the pilsner to rule them all - tried beside each other at a lunch table there is no match for the urquell - it’s just a beer - and it’s the best of pilsners."
"wish i tasted this one before miller got its grubby hands on it. they reduced it to little more than their miller high life. clear yellow with white thin head, soapy water and bread flavor. not terrible, not great."
"Pour clear golden yellow with creamy white head. Aroma grassy, biscuit and zesty smell, very slightly skunky. Taste grassy hops nice malty balance slight bitterness. MF crisp and super easy to drink. This is a go to great beer that is super easy to drink and refreshing one word respect."
"When sitting in the U Zlateu Tigre (probably not the correct spelling, sorry) pub in Praha this is the best beer in the world. Perfekt balance between refreshing and body. Lovely creamy foam on top. Level of diacetyl is also perfect."
"Love this stuff.  This is how a pilsner should taste.  It pours perfect, clear, but slightly golden yellow with a light, foamy head that quickly dissipates.  The aroma is sweet grassy malts, and a little citrusy hops.  Taste is a perfect balance of sweet, barnyardy malts and bitter hops.  It’s simple, it’s clean, it’s refreshing.  The finish is long and bitter... just as a pilsner should be.  This is one of the world’s great beers."
"bottle@bar: had this one before, had it once slightly skunked, I feel like even when it isn’t skunked, it sort of has that very light quality or maybe it just always gets skunked here, expected more from this one, very average, kind of thin, light hops, minor bitterness in the aftertaste, mostly hoppy, dry & bitter"
"Michael Jackson, rest his soul, rated this a world-class pilsner. It’s the original pilsner for crying out loud and do I see ratings in the 2’s? Apologies for not being ’extreme’ enough or alcoholic enough but for the finest example of the style, look no further. I don’t care if they have gone from 5 strains of yeast to 2 or if they brew it in Poland and Russian now under SABMiller or if it’s not as malty as it was in nineteen aught four, this is Pilsner Urquell, the original pilsner, a class unto itself."
Very good pilsner. One of must to try if you have a chance. Expecially good for hot summers :)
"Clear golden with a white head. Aroma is malty, fruity and light hoppy - flowers. Flavor is medium sweet and quite bitter. Bitter and dry finish. Soft. Excellent pilsener. 140810"
"Bottle. Mount Albert, Ontario. I yhink I need a more powerful palette to tell my why this is supposed to be special. Not much here to differentiate between a carlsberg or a heineken - though the bottle has expired and I might need a new sample. Nice amber pour.  Tough, skunky flavor. Not nice. Not smooth. I am not a fan at all. I might be in the minority here bit I don’t find anything worth coming back to in the original pilsner. Shocking disappointment."
"Can. Deep golden, white head. Smells of grass and malts. Sweet malty dry taste and powerful hoppy finish. Good feel in mouth"
"500 mL bottle at home poured into a pint glass.  Dark golden pilsner with a slightly washing up liquid head.  Smells very Czech, malty but ok.  first taste a bit metallic and weak.  I’m a bit disappointed by the original pilsner.  It’d be alright on a cold day but otherwise its shandy fodder."
"The original pilsner. Doesn’t quite do it for me, perhaps I expected too much. Glad pilsners have improved what since 1842."
"It’s hard to comment on the flavour because there really wasn’t any. Had a slight sweet finish and was smooth and drinkable, but otherwise boring"
"Cheap, and a classic, get it fresh in the paper 12 pack. It pours a deep gold and has a mellow malt and hop balance."
"On tap in Prague - pours a golden yellow. Flavour is crisp, grass, hops and well-balanced. Decent."
"Smells and tastes skunked. Watery, slight bitterness, honeywater, sour apple. Not very good."
"Clean good taste, just perfect pilsner. Strong carbonoxide, good long after taste. Love it."
"500ml can. Clear golden yellow, frothy large bubbly white head that settles into a thin lacing. Bready and sweet aroma, bit of funk, taste is not like I remember - sweet, bit of barnyard, some bitterness. Not sure if its because its from a can or just off but definitely not what I remember. Will have to try again on tap at some point and re-rate."
"A: The beer pours a clear golden color with approximately one finger of foam.

S: Smells pretty much like I remember it. Mostly bread and biscuit type malt notes but there is a slight hoppiness to it that I would describe as floral and spicy.…"
Aroma is distinct for the style.  Color is pure gold.  taste is a complex back and forth between malt sweetness and hop bitterness.  It is simulataneously incredibly malty and hoppy.  More malt than you would expect for such a light beer.  The end is sharply bitter with a slight lingering sweetness.
"Benchmark beer, the malt is so bready, hay and bread flavors with lots of bitterness. Hops have a pepper and grass moderate aroma. Nice balance of the poles of the bready, saltine-like malt character and the noble hop bitterness character. Fresh bottle, best before mid-May. Nice effervescence throughout."
"Bottle 330 ml. golden, clear appearance with a lasting thin head. Aroma: Sweet, hoppy, diacetyl, unfortunately quite oxidised. Sweet (sweeter than I remember) taste with a distinct bitterness. Light body with average carbonation, a bit oily in palate. The beer was very oxidised which lowers the aroma and overall score. I don´t  think that´s acceptable when it is 5 months left of the shelf life. The high sweetness lowers the taste and overall score for me as well . I must say that I´m dissapointed of the beer in the bottle I drunk. I will try it again some time to see if it was a coincidence. C"

"Bottle shared by my brother. Clear yellow pour with a medium white head. Pilsner malt nose with crisp noble hops. Pilsner malt flavor with a crisp, clean bitter finish. Pretty solid for the style."
"12oz bottle. Rating #2324. Light hold pour with a little white head. Skunky aroma with some light hops and crisp maltiness. Flavor had some bite, a little oxidized and an underlying clean maltiness. (1471)"
"35cl bottle. Good as always, great hop taste, perfect for a late summer night."
On tap at Monk’s Table.  Pours a clear golden yellow with modest-sized white head.  Aroma is quite bready with a pleasant grassiness.  Taste is also quite bready with a bit of fruity sweetness.  Modest grassy bitterness in the crisp finish.  Fairly fizzy carbonation.  A nice pilsener.
"Clear gold with a small white head. Stringy lacing. The aroma is very doughy, with some potent Saaz hops. The flavor is grainy pils malt with strong, grassy hop bitterness. Well balanced and very refreshing. Light body with soft, fizzy carbonation. Great pils."
"Apperance: Pours a translucent golden yellow with a medium, frothy head. Aroma: Smells sweetly of hops. Not much else. Palate: Smooth, but not watery. Taste: Quite bitter, but also sweet. Pleasurably bitter finish. One of the few pilsners I actually enjoy."
"Clear golden with a nice little white head that actually laces. Really clean aroma of bread, hay, some earthiness and floral hops. It tastes slightly sweet, with distinct hop presence, though bitterness is low; a very well balanced beer. It definitely tastes like a beer made from the right ingredients. It’s not thick, but it’s not watery either. Crisp, with a slight bitter finish, and very good amongst any kind of pale lager."
"Stiil the best Pisener Ive ever tasted. Over twenty years, Ive never experienced a drop in quality. I think what sets it apart from other pilseners is the delightful complexity of the beer. Its the exact opposite of bland. Theres a floral presence in the hops, which combined with subtle hints of citrus in the finish, provides a lasting, pleasant aftertaste. I always take this beer with me to Kruger Park in South Africa. At the end of a long, hot Afican day, theres absolutely nothing to touch an ice-cold, slender glass of Pilsner Urquell. It even surpasses a great G&T!"
"500ml bottle from Partridges in Chelsea. Pours golden yellow, well carbonated with foamy off-white head. Nose; dominant hay/grass and some citrus. Taste; velvety mouthfeel, grassy, slight lemon, smooth, crisp but a bit weak. As lagers go its pretty good (i.e. better than fosters), but not for me."
"Not too bad. Has a decent amount of flavor. Its a little strong, but clean crisp acidic and smells like bready, alcohol. Finishes decent, overall a good selection, especially if youre in Czech when sipping"
"500 mL can.  Poured at home.  Pours beautiful honey colour with white one and half inch head.  Head dissipated slowly, with good amount of lace.  Really nice aroma, hints of citrus, perhaps pineapple?, and hoppy nose.  Good full flavour for a pilsner, hoppy finish that lasts nicely.  A great beer to have on a summer day if you are hanging out with other beer snobs.  However, as a session beer I would hit a PBR or some other macro swill.  At only 4.4%, it won’t do you too much good.  A great beer though, no doubt."
"Bottle 50 cl. Poured clear dark golden colour with white head. Aroma is hops, sweet malt and grass. Flavour is sweet butterscotch in the beginning with a slight bitter grassy hop ending."
Pours a golden color with white head.  Aroma is bready.  Taste is malty on the front end and hoppy on the back.  A bold taste for a pils.  Enjoyable and refreshing.
"The original and the....well one of the best. Deep goldenrod in colour with a soft white and lovely textured pillow on top. Floral and lovely inviting citrus-herb bitterness, a moderate carbonation make for a great session beer for all occasions....finishes a touch bitter as expected...great beer."
Poured from a bottle into an English pint glass. Appearance is a clear gold with an enormously white head. Aroma is skunky. Taste is a bit skunky and not much else. The beer is a pretty big disappointment but I’m glad I finally tried it.
"Pours a clear straw with a big white head. The flavour is dominated by slightly sweet malts and bread and then there are som underlying Saaz hops that brings that slightly spicy and grassy aroma. Some bitterness in the end. Decent pilsner, and I can imagine it being better when very fresh. No way near the unfiltered version of PU though."
"Bottle.  Pours a clear gold with fast-fasing head and a lot of bubbles.  Flavor is straw/hay, some earthiness, slight hops.  Very smooth, easy to drink."
"CAn 500ml. Pours clear golden with frothy off-white head. Aroma is mild citrus, bit of hay. Taste is medium going into light bitter and a tiny bit salty. Medium bodied,  lightly oily with average carbonation and bitter finish."
"Pilsner Urquell has a medium, white head and a clear, golden appearance, with fine suspended white particles throughout.  Carbonation is moderate, and the aroma is of bread (not skunked, either- green bottle).  The taste is delicious, with bread and barley malt the key features, and a nice hop background.  Mouth-feel is light and watery, and Pilsner Urquell finishes refreshing and not as dry as American-style lagers.  Overall, I really enjoyed this sample and highly recommend giving this beer a try.…"
"Dark gold colour, with small white head. Aroma is typical pilsner with intensive yeast and hops fragrances. Taste is medium bitter, with low-key yeast inthe after-taste."
"Bottle. Poured to a golden yellow. Clear. White head that dissipated, but not too quickly. Crisp hoppy and grassy aroma. Has some bite to it, but not harsh to the palate. High carbonation. Nice spicy hop start with malt flavors as well. Bitter finish, but clean. Nice refreshing taste. I enjoyed this pilsner, and it is one of my favorites. Works well in a Black and Tan as well."
"Bottle courtesy and shared with the in-law. Nice sweet malt in the nose, continues in the sip with mild bitter overtones. Not my favorite style, but a very nice beer!"
"12 oz bottle into pilsner glass. Crystal clear straw color with bright white head and lively carbonation. Minimal lacing. Very gentle aroma of doughy malt. Very little hops in the nose. Taste is initially all about malt, with lightly sweet grain dominating most of the drink. The finish is dominated by a good deal of bitterness, with the hop character being very refined...a little spicy, a little earthy. No citrus or pine in these noble Saaz hops. Good clean lager fermentation with no esters that I can detect, although I do get a bit diacetyl. A light and dry mouthfeel.  The style is not my favorite, but I could drin…"
"Clear yellow, medium head. Crisp hops and malts in the nose. Malty sweetness (with notes of caramel) transforms into a pleasantly strong hoppy finish. Very nice and refreshing."
Draught in a bar in Berlin - 17/12/10.Golden and nice looking lager. Pretty tasty with a hoppy taste and dry finish.
"bottled. great aroma and excellent appearance, taste way too bitter for me but generally a very ""noble"" beer. epic in every sense of the word. and my great-grandfather was a minority shareholder of the pilsner brewery in 1930s :-))"
Bottle pours gold with a white head.  All I can say is this beer is all over the place as far as consistancy goes due the glass but when it’s fresh it’s not too shabby.  Prime example of a czech lager.
"The beer pours crystal clear, a perfect Pilsner in the glass, very light white head, fizzy bubbles coming up from the bottom, but WHAT IS THAT SMELL like dirty feet UGGGGhh!   The flavour was clean and crisp, but the dirty feet smell really drops this one into the drain.  Not sure how they have survived more than 100 years with this recipe."
"Really good widely distributed beer, has even some uniqueness. Kind of a standard pilsener for me."
"on tap at many places in Prague, unfiltered, in 30cl or 50cl.  Brewed in Prague"
"0.5l box. Pours a nice clear golden body with a thin creamy head and loath of carbonation. Nose is fruity and you can really get a good sense of the saazy hops. Taste is mild, perfectly bitter with hints of vanilla and a almost butter-sweet malt taste on the tip of the tongue. All patriotism set aside, in my opinion this is the best lager you can get. Easy as that!"
"This pours a beautiful golden color with a thick, foamy head. It has a crisp, biscuit-y flavor with a dash of bitterness. Tasty - the quintessential pilsner."
"Moderate hoppy with notes of straw. Average, frothy, white head. Good lacing. Mostly lasting longevity. Clear, yellow body. Moderate bitter flavor. Light to medium palate."
"Draught in Prague. This is the original Pilsner that started the lager revolution. Many brewers have tried to copy it, some succesfull others not so succesfull. This is simply the best of all Pilsners money can buy. Period."
"Bottle. Clear golden with a white head. Aroma has notes of hops, grains and some sweetness from malts. Flavour has notes of bread, hops and ends in a sweet bitterness."
"Grassy aroma. Light bitter flavor, frothy in the mouth. Finishes with a lasting grapefruit taste."
"A very enjoyable pilsner. Good smooth flavor. If you like Czech pilners, this will satisfy. It does have snappy bitterness, but it is the style of beer."
"The Queen of the Pils. A nice amber yellow colour, sparkling liquide, with a nice white head. Aromas of hops, malts and peas. A little bitterness at the begining, but quickly overcome by a lively carbonation and the refreshing taste of this great Pils."
"bottle.  Pours orange gold with minimal white head.  Earthy, floral aroma, malty - corn, peas, carrots.  There is also a creamy sweet aspect to the aroma, like whipped cream.  Flavor presents a clean, crisp, good tasting pilsener, which at first presents a subtly hopped bite that moves to sweeter malts, and features a slightly bitter finish.  Nice."
"0.5l Bottle.  Pours a beautiful deep gold, almost orange.  Aroma is heavily hops with a little skunkiness.  Taste is a lot more complex than I expected - amazing sweet malt with very prominent bread flavor and a nice hop bite.  Finishing is hop bitterness with a long lasting sweet aftertaste, almost like I had just eaten some candy."
"Very smooth, easy drinking, but not a whole lot to it in the flavor department. Average in my book.
On tap at U Vejvodu in Prague: Medium-bodied and dry, a notch below Budvar."
"Smells grainy, pours yellow hue with litthe head turns to thin ring.  Mouth feel is tingly and highly carbonated.  Taste has a bite to it.  First brew of it’s style.  Aftertaste is crisp.  Enjoyed with lake perch @ Lansing KC hall.."
"Draught. Clear golden colour with large white head. Hoppy aroma with some malt in it. Bitter hops and some malt as well as butanedione, which resuts in buttery taste as well as oily palate. Bitter finish."
Re-rating this...500ml can...My tastes over the years have grown and now I have gained much respect for this beer.  Pours gold with an above average white head.  Sweet than bitter dry finish.  Nicely balanced. Very affordable right now here in Canada ;)
"Very drinkable, goes down easy, refreshing, with a sharp bitterness that is typical for the style, surprisingly flavorful, bitterness lingers after it goes down.  Highly carbonated.  Haven’t had a ton of other Pilsners, but this is very good for the money and is widely available.  Good session/summer beer."
Clear golden color in the glass. Bready pilsner malt aroma with noble hop accents. Clean finish. The classic standard for pilsners.
Very balanced lager. It’s fresh and you can taste just the right amount of hopses floral aroma. Works always.
"Little too bitter for a pilsner, I believe the can I had may have been old. But it was unstatisfactory."
"Bottled:
Pours a pale golden colour with a dense head. Butter, cookie dough and honey on the nose with some herbal notes of hops. Big herbal and grassy bitterness, somewhat thin mouth feel."
"A classic I just had to rate at some point. Pours a clear and light amber orange with a barely noticeable head. Nose is all honey and bread, with hints of caramel malt. I like. Very smooth on the palate. Taste is equally very light, low on the hops and with a smooth honey aftertaste. Almost ale-like, in a way. Very drinkable and a nice brew; I understand why this has become the standard to compare by in the world of pilsners."
"Originally rated April 2004. Appearance is golden amber with a medium head that leaves hardly any lacing. Pilsner Urquell has quite a significant amount of carbonation, with bigger bubbles then most beers. First scent of skunk quickly disappeares to let a floral one settle. Taste is on the bitter side with a smooth finish. A good session beer."
"Pours yellow with white head, aroma of grass and earthy hops, touch of bread and grain, pretty dry and bitter finish.  Pretty good for a pilsener, has some good tastes."
"A good example of the style with surprising hoppy bitterness (to me - for the style).  Not my favorite style of beer, but if it were the best choice available on a beer list, I’d get it.  Frankly, the only reason I bought this 12 pack is because I got a free (and REALLY great) Pilsner Urquell pilsner stem glass with it :)  WELL worth the purchase - pretty decent beer, spectacular glass."
"On tap at the 331 club.  Pours a golden orange with a little head.  Sure am glad I am drinking this on tap and not from a skunky green bottle.  Aroma of hay, grass, and earthy hops.  A crisp, robust, and full bodied flavor lead into a slightly astringent finish.  Refreshing as hell on tap, not skunky at all as it would be from a bottle."
"On tap.  Golden in color.  Aroma is sweet and malty with a hint of hops in the background.  Much better than the skunky aroma one would likely get from a bottle.  Flavor is bready with a nice and crisp bitterness in the finish.  Rather refreshing, and thankfully not at all skunky. I really can’t emphasize the lack of skunkiness more."
"500ml bottle.  Pours light golden with a large frothy head.  Aroma is grassy hops and pale malt.  Bready malt start, grassy faint hops to finish.  Very smooth."
"My all time favorite Czech Pilsner. Smooth, Mellow and very bitter from Saaz hops, Probably the best hops in the world that i have bought! These hops are very special due to the low 2.8 Alpha Acid content and grown in the Czech Republic! They couldn’t be more refreshing with Bohemia’s purest waters! Definitely a beer you should keep stocked in the fridge!"
"Bottle to mug.  Light yellow, clear.  Classic pilsner taste.  Very enjoyable."
"POurs gold with a thin white film of a head.  Aroma is grassy.  Taste is sweet, honey undertones.  Very light and easy to drink."
"Pours pale straw yellow, nose is grainy with hints of floral, taste is a little soapy."
"This pours a deep golden yellow with high levels of effervescence and a medium sized white head. The aroma is of wet dog and skunk with a few light, grassy notes. It has a grassy, grainy taste with lots of skunkiness. For the beer that started it all, this is depressing."
"Pure gold in tone.  Nose is sweet, crisp malt.  Sweet malt at first, with a mild, clean and crisp bitter on the finish. Biscuity and slightly soapy notes admist the malt and hop flavors.  A good beer, just in a style I’m not a huge fan of."
"Bottle.  Well crafted standard Pils. The dictionary definition.. but who reads a dictionary? Light straw/hay color.. a decent balance of grain and slight floral hops. Very clean, very crisp.. fairly dry.. Good acidic finish.. a great beer for a session with non-beer drinking beer buddies."
"Reminds me of Stella Artois - a grassy taste with some bitterness afterward. Not the best, but not the worst."
"Golden yellow.  Uncomplicated aroma with grass/hay.  Refreshing to drink, pleasantly sour, light enough but interesting enough to drink at least a few.  Much better on tap than from the bottle, or maybe it was just the atmosphere."
"Bottle @ Metro Billiards. 4.4%. Clear yellow colour, nice white foam. Taste is quite good, light and fairly sweet, aroma is pleasant and hoppy. Certainly my favourite pilsner thus far, and fitting, given that this is the benchmark."
"Can. Clear gold pour, thin white head. Aroma of wet grain spicy hops and lager yeast. Taste is bitter, quite hoppy. Palate is sparkling and enjoyable, too bad they don’t sell this in quebec anymore."
"Ah, the standard.  Sweet cereal nose, held down a bit by the hops, though the bitterness never stands out aromatically.  Creamy pale gold, cottony white head.  Everything I want in a pils.  Light grassy body and a snappy crisp bitter finish.  Even still, I do not find myself being ’wowed’ on a hedonistic level."
"2010 - 08 - 19 today had 1/2 liter from tap at a restaurant at Praha 9, yesterday had 0.33 ml can at Macdonalds at Praha 1. nice pilsner, cold form tap it was pretty okay !!"
"On tap in PRague, I liked this beer 5 years ago, it was the best cz beer. Now it is bitter and sweet too. Big company (SAB) has to decrease costs and the origin taste is away. Only kvasnicovy Pilsner Urquell in pub Na Parkane is the origin"
"Bottle. Clear golden with white head. Aromas of grass, grain, herb, flower. Flavors of grain, herbs, honeysuckle, citrus. Crisp and clean. Well balanced. Medium-thin body with smooth, slick mouth feel and soft, aggressive carbonation."
"Walk like a pilsner? Talk like a pilsner? Yep, it’s a pilsner. Not much more to say, standard but decently executed."
"16 oz can from the Four Firkins.  Light, straw colored pour with a fluffy several fingered head.  Aroma is initially somewhat sulfury but that quickly fades and leaves behind a beautiful fresh baked bread aroma.  Very faint hops flavor, it’s mostly malty with a ton more of the baked bread notes.  Slightly bitter bite in the finish but some nice sweetness balances that out."
"Bottle. Pours a golden honeyish yellow color, with some orange notes, and a frothy bright white head. Aroma is fairly grainy with a slight amount of hops and malts. Flavor is of grains a nice grassy and citric hoppy flavor, along with some malts. The body is crisp with a very carbonated mouthfeel. Overall a pretty good and refreshing Pilsener, one of my favorites of the style."
"Bottle- Beer pours with a nice golden color, with a decent head and good carbonation. The aroma not distinct as it had a grainy smell. The taste is crisp and refreshing with a medium body and dry finish. Beer is very drinkable and a good session beer. I understand there have been some changes to the brewing process. Too bad they messed with the original."
"This is the best beer on the world!!! I have drink a lot of other brands of beers, but this is the only one, the best."
"Don’t write this one off just because it’s widely available. If Michael Jackson says it’s his favorite interpretation of the style, then you better hop on it. Pours golden, small white head. Nose is crisp and clean, floral. Taste is wonderful; despite the green bottle, this is not at all skunky. Light and floral, with spare, but present hops. Would make this my anytime beer if it weren’t so pricey down here."
"Draught. Dark golden colour with a ful white head, looks superb. Tasteof gentle malt. Low gas and a nice bitter aftertaste."
"If you claim to like pilsner beer and haven’t tried this one... shame on you!
Pours a beautiful, deep, golden color, with a nice head. Hops dominate the nose, but with a caramel-malt background there as well.

"On tap at the Princess of Wales, Blackheath. Golden pour with a white head. Citrus aromas with a splash of warm bread and barley. Flavours of orange peel and grapefruit. Crisp, bitter finish."
"Brought to me from the Czech Republic. Non-offensive, slightly yeasty, wouldn’t have it again."
I’ve had this on tap in in bottles.  Pretty decent pilsner.  I’d recommend if it were on sale though.
"On tap at Bella, Strizkov, Prague on 9th July 2010. Gold with diminishing white frothy head. Richly hoppy with slight savoury touch alongside notes of grassiness and herbiness. A citric tang on the tongue. The full taste is rounded and I found the beer to be quenching, refreshing and satisfying of flavour. Just what you need on a 30 degree July day, too!"

"An excellent choice for a BBQ night.  My favourite Pilsener yet and, fortunately, pretty easy to find at any local liquor store.  A pretty safe choice for me"
"On tap from La Maripepa in Madrid. Persistent bubbly head with a bright golden pour. Soft, creamy vanilla with hops and fresh bread. Extremely refreshing. Enjoyed this more than my last green import bottle. A classic."
"Pours a clear golden yellow, with moderately energetic bubbly head.  Caramel malts, but mostly it’s about the grassy hops that are there from start to finish.  Crisp and clean, easily drinkable.  Very light."
"(Can 50 cl.) Pours golden with a nice white head. Good body for a 4,4% beer. Nice soft lingering sazz hop bitterness. My favourite pilsener, but better from a bottle and much better from tap in Praque ;-)"

"500ml can.  Pours a clear gold with a foamy white head.  Malt, grass, and glycerin on the nose.  Taste has heavy initial bread notes, followed by malt, faint honey and a nice hoppy finish."
"Tap. Color dark yellow with medium white head. Aroma hop, earth. Taste hop, grass, bitter finish."
"Tap. White head, rapidly leaving, pale yellow color, pleasant nose with nice hops, flavor mild with nothing much there, watery palate, which reminded me why beers were brewed in the middle ages (purify water), so I think this shows the evolution of beers over the last few decades."
Not one for pilsners but this is relatively inoffensive.  Clear gold pour with slight carbonation.  Sweet hay/grass dominates the aroma.  Some sense of hops in the flavor but not a whole lot else.
"Aroma of hay, yeast, and grain.  A darker shade of gold than most pilsners, with a short lasting white head.  This beer is all about the yeast, as it adds a distinct earthiness and herbal quality to the flavor.  It is highly hopped for a pilsner, which brings a pleasant bitterness and clean finish.  Low carbonation, somewhat creamy mouthfeel, very refreshing."
"Nice and balanced, drinkable. Cereal malt, grassy hops. Pretty good, but not as good as I was hoping."
12 Oz . Pours clear pale gold with light head that subsides quickly.  Aroma of light citrus hops and smooth hay-ish light malts.  Taste is mildly bitter and light sweetness.   Light body with very easing drinking smooth finish.   Great for a warm day and its the original pilsner so definitely holds its value.
Bottle. Golden color with a slightly skunky aroma   A little malty sweetness and then a spicey hop presence that lingers. . Finishes dry with a slight fruity flavor.
"4.19.10Bottle. Faint notes of golden malt and perfectly balanced bitterness.  Incrediblly light body followed with a biscuit like malt richness.  The crisp finish does not take away but rather enhances the malt-hop balance.  Saaz hops add a delicate yet spicy aroma.  A very good Bo-pils, excellent for those new to beer or new to the style.

"Pours a light gold color in the glass. Nose and taste are a little floral, lots of peppers and spice. Rated 1/13/2000"
"Too ingratiatingly sweet for me and some odd aromas because of that, but overall nicely light to drink."
Draught.  Pours light golden with average white head.  Aroma is very hoppy with some notes of fruit and malts.  Taste is similar with a strong hop presence and subtle malt and fruit undertones.  A very crisp and dry finish.  A nice beer but a little too strong in the hop department for me to rate any higher.
"what is denial? this is the king of beers, all right an a little bit too dry one"
"473ml can. Pours a very giner ale golden color with white head and very, very little lace. Smells dominantly of light apple cider.  Taste is mostly classic ""green bottle"" beer with a little hint of apple cider. A little thin on the palate. Overall a little interesting but nothing to write home about. A quick e-mail would do."

"Pours a clear gold with thin head. Not my favorite, standard pilsner with a little more bitterness, i think its kind of ""Meh""."
"Pours a beautiful clear gold.  It’s fun to look at the surface of the fluid from underneath and observe the table reflected off of it with the bubbles steadily rising and getting caught in it then popping, like snow on the ground when its not quite cold enough.  The smell... mmm how surprising when put next to other pilsners.  It is sweet and yet subtly smokey, like corn that was roasted for too long over a fire.  The flavor is similar with the sweetness being more sweet and less funkily entangled with smoky malt.  It feels nice and finishes with a mild bitterness that I like."
"Bottle, home.  Pours a very pretty golden color, a shade darker than most pilseners that I’ve had, transparent, tight white head.  The aroma has notes of grass, yeast and clean grain.  The flavor is yeasty, drier than most pilsener-style lagers, more clean grain with a light hoppy bitterness.  Refreshing and drinkable but definitely not the best pilsener."
"The classic Pilzen. What can I say? A classic head, lovely on the eye. A great golden haze of wonder. Just how a pilzen should be. Poured into stein glass. The bottle is imported from Czech Republic. It is quite fresh but like all hells and good pilsners this style needs to be drunk QUICKLY. I have had this in Prague too. There is a lovely light texture however a slighrt off metalicy edge. It’s very intersting. I get hey; citrus hops and doughy yeast. The beer is good. It’s classic. It should be respected and we have a duty to prevent this beer being degraded for the wider commerical world. This is wha…"
"Pours golden with a white head. Aroma is malt, grassy hop and butterscotch. Flavour is malt, medium bitter, butterscotch and grassy hop."
"From the bottle. Pours a golden brown color, darker than most Euro-macros. There is some grass in the nose, but not much. Taste is lightly sweet up front, smooth, with a medium bitter finish. The body is medium, bubbly. In Prague this flowed like nectar of the Gods and was obviously more fresh there. Here, it’s a little more skunky. Overall a good import when I get nostalgic for Praha."
Can from San Roque Liquors. Pours golden in color with 2 fingers white head. Aroma is rich in breadiness with hops in the background. Full flavored and very enjoyable.
"Bottle, 330 ml. Soft, smooth. Not much carbonation. Unfortanetely I drunk it too hot, because on holiday. Slightly bitter, nice pilsner.
3 april 2010: On tap in Prague, several places. Same impression, soft and smooth. Thick head, creamy, good lacing. Very nice pilsner."
"This is a beer that doesn’t travel well, and by the time the export version reaches the States it has lost much of what it truly special.  If you are an aficionado of pilsner-style beer, then you must make the trek to the brewery in Plzen.  One taste of this beer, fresh from the tap, and you understand why this is the model for all the rest that came after it."
"Bottle. Pours a clear and dark yellow/golden beer with a white head. The aroma is malt, sweetness and hops with flowers. The flavor is malt, caramel and sweetness. The palate is sweet. Overall a really good beer, a classic."
"Can (50 cl) from systembolaget. Clear, deep golden, medium white frothy head. Bready malt aroma, with a distinct amount of creamy butterscotch, and floral hops. Medium bodied and smooth. Nice and long bitter finish. A great pilsener."
Pours a medium yellow with a light white head. Taste is astringent and a stingy aftertaste remains.
"330mL bottle.  Pours clear pale gold with a thin persistent head.  Aroma of citrus and grass but also slightly light struck.  Fairly crisp flavour, slight malty sweetness and decent bitterness.  Light bodied, average carbonation with a lingering bitter finish."
"From the bottle. I was trying to wait until I got it from the tank again in CZ, but, well, I had one. Deep, glowing, crystal clear golden color with a tall head. Malty, bread / biscuit aroma with grassy and slightly skunky hops. Ruch, fruity malt, bready as hell. Nice hop balance, though really not fragrant. Rich and thick yet not too heavy. Such a distinctive flavor. Still great, though it makes me long for the unpasteurized version again."
"Bottle at home. Pours a clear golden color with a small, creamy white head. Aroma of grains and slightly skunked. Nice full bitter pilsener flavor with a nice amount of hops. Decent carbonation and a nice bitter finish. Slightly skunked though, shall have been the green bottle. Should try this in a can when I have the opportunity."
"While I have had a Pilsner Urquel in the past, it had been so long that it was a distant memory. Drinking the one I had last night was basically like having the beer for the first time. I have to say that this is easily one of the best Pils that I have ever had in my life. For a low octane pilsner, it just about impossible to beat. The beer pours clean with a typical light head. It looks just like a pils should. The aroma was spicy and vegetal. Weird but cool. Nice hop presence. Nose is potent. The beer tastes great. I hate most Pils because they remind my of shitty American beer. This is not one of those at all.…"
"Pours a bright yellow color and a bright white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is light hops with some grains and alcohol. The taste is similar, with some additional sweet honey notes. Crisp, clean mouthfeel.  Good for the style, but not my personal preference."
"Can, clear golden with white head, aroma of clean malt with spicy noble hops and a hint of grass, huge hop bitters up front without much hop flavor, crisp and clean malt finish, lasting hop bitters on palate, highly carbonated with slight carbonic acid bite"
"This is an excellent pilsener.  Rich gold color with lively carbonation; aromas of malt, acid, touch of bitter hops, and hay.  Flavor is dry and a bit acidic; crisp and refreshing, distinct Saaz hops.  A hint of wood aromas on the end.  One of the best pilseners commonly available."

Golden blond, average foam on fine crackling appetizing. Malty nose with a floral bouquet, spicy, caramel and the hops. Aromatic, smooth and well-balanced. Finesse hoppy bitterness which persists and signs. A pils reference."
"Not bad. Super light beers aren’t usually my thing but this is something you can drink like soda. No complaints. Just not exciting. Very smooth and clean with good carbonation. This is my first beer of this style, but for a lake of being able to compare it to its own style... compared your typical pale lager, this stuff is pretty good."
"(sample)  Pours a gold color.  Interesting aroma of cloves and banana.  Has a herbal hop nose also.  Tastes of great quality pale malt, has a light herbal hoppiness.  Also has an interesting yeast component too.  Oily texture, soft carbonation and pleasing finish."
A golden yellow beer with a white head. Flowery and hoppy aroma. Taste is malty and hoppy. Dry end slightly bitter end. Very good pilsener
"Bottle. Golden/ Amber pour, medium creamy/soapy head.
Typical Czech pilsener aroma with full malts and hops. Nice.
Full flavour of malts and hops, good balance. Bitter hops after taste.
Now this is a pilsener!"
"Pours dark yellow with a thin white head that quickly fades to nothing.  The aroma is grassy hops.  The flavors are grass, light bread, and slight bitterness.  Light body and mild carbonation."
pours a deep yellow under a thick white head. Nose is hops and a light malt sweetness. Initial taste is much the same with the maltiness coming on strong. I do like this. The palate is just smooth enough under the hop bite and it does finish a light hoppy bitter with a touch of malt. Very nice beer. One I’ll have to keep in the beer fridge as a regular stock item.
"12oz bottle. Pours a classic Pilsner golden straw color with a white bubbly head. Smells a bit bready with a tad of grass. Taste is most definitely bready, every so slightly sweet. Not good on head retention, but a fantastic Pilsner nonetheless. Why would anyone expect anything but from the original brewers?"
"This beer comes with a lot of hype, but it just doesn’t have anything that makes it special.  Straw yellow pour, light head with a grassy dry taste.  I think this might be one of those beers you have to try extremely fresh to appreciate."
"Not really a Pilsener fan, and though we’d hoped differently, this didn’t do much to change that . . .  Poured from the bottle a clear golden-yellow with an adequate, though short-lived, head.  Good hops aroma and bitterness.  Good carbonation and strong finish.  This beer was much better for me with food than simply by itself.  A good Pilsener, no doubt, but not to our taste."
Pours clear and golden with a decent white head. Mild fruity and flowery hop aroma. Medium bodied and is slightly bitter and spicy with a nice fruity flavour.
"Aroma is skunky, corn, malts.  The appearance is yellow/orange (darker than normal pils), white head.  The flavor is malt, grass, sweet malts, skunky.  The finish is a noble hops bittering, lingering.  The beer is medium-body, creamy mouthfeel.  Ok for what it is."
"Very good pilsner beer. Czech brewed. Pleasant bitterness, complex taste. Smooth body."
Skunky hoppy.  Orange golden coloured.  Taste is hoppy for this style and moderately bitter.  Not a fan of pilsners overall.
"Aroma was a little skunky and the taste was a bit skunky too.  However, the beer looked great in the glass with a good head - too bad it didn’t taste as good as it looks.  I wish I could rate this without it being skunky, must every time I can remember having this beer, including this one tonight, it’s always just not been very good to me."
"Not a favorite.  Bottle to pilsner glass.  Pours golden with a white head that lasts awhile.  Floral malts give it a pleasant nose, but that is where the pleasant stops.  Thin and light in the mouth.  Taste is sharp and bitter, they over did it.  It has a weird lingering astringent after taste that reminds me of alum.  I will Czech it off my list."
"Bottle. Clear, yellow and highly carbonated. Nose is very malty and astringent. Taste is supremely sharp with a nice malt and subdued hop taste. Drinkable but the tanginess doesn’t leave me asking for much more of this."
"From a 330ml bottle on 1/2/2010. The original pilsener is a lovely, refreshing, distinctive drop, which is perfect for a session. Has a sweet, malty aroma, which is reflected in the flavour, and a fabulous hoppy finish."
"crisp sour apple taste, awesomely refreshing on a hot day, in my top 5 imports"
The most famous czech beer but I personally I´m not a fan and never will be. I found nothing special in the taste or/and aroma. It´s overhyped beer.
"Serving: 12 oz. bottle.
I’ve been meaning to rate this one for ages, but for some reason never got around to it.  On with it then.  It pours a clear, pale gold color with a frothy white head.  Decent head retention.   The nose is crisp and bold with spicy and floral hops taking center stage.  The flavor follows suit with the spicy side really coming through.  Crisp and slightly dry, this is a very refreshing beer.  A decent bitter finish ends things.  This is…"
"12 oz bottle - Note, I am not a pilsner fan.  I’ve had too many flavorless, yellow, fizzy beers in the style.  But this one is actually pretty good.  Pours a fairly thick, moderate duration head, not much lacing.  Taste is pretty light as one would expect for a pilsner, but finishes with the bite of Euro hoppiness.  It lacks complexity, but I could drink a few of these without complaint.…"
"Bottle. Full of strong, hoppy bitterness, with the trademark Czech pils tang and dryness. This is balanced by some honeycomb sweetness and a hint of biscuit, but, overall, the lingering finish is one that still makes you slightly suck your cheeks in......"
Yellow-transparent pour with a white head.  The aroma is of pine and lemon.  Flavor of citrus and urine.  I’d take a light macrobrew over this one.  Bitter and skunky... maybe I’m just not a pale lager type of guy.
"Golden color, small white head; aroma of floral hops, some fruitness and maltiness; mouthfeel is quite soft and still crispy with just right amount of carbonation; flavor is slightly malty sweet at first while the hops are getting ready for the dry and bitter finish."
"Pours a goldish yellow. Not much of a head, fades rapidly. Floral malt  hop aroma. Medium hop taste with a hint of fruit. Nice light bitter finish. Perfect amount of carbonation that stays to the end. There are other Czech beers I like better, but this is a real nice Pils. You can’t go wrong with this one."
Pours a golden hue into the glass with a white head. I get lots of malts with some floral hops on the nose. Lots of flavor too. Finishes with a nice aftertaste of the hops which makes you want to take another sip. Definitely a complex brew. I would drink this again for sure.
in bottle; good solid pilsner. It is a light wheaty and dry almost like champagne. I would say it is much better on tap than in bottle
"Bottle 330ml. Not bad, not great. Aroma has straw, flowers, and malt. Flavour is sweet, with light bitterness; nice, but with short duration. Oily in the palate, but thin body. Dark yellow, with a white head that disappears."
Why I have to rate and explain this kind of original beer. Only enjoy with this taste that let to drink a lot with no one change. Salud!
"Pours a vivid golden color with a small white head. Light aromas of mostly malt and wheat. Good balance between the malt and hops, and had a nice dry finish. This is maybe my favorite of the macro European lagers."
"Golden yellow pour with a lingering white head.  A sour, fruity nose. Refreshing, light body. Some maltiness with a crisp bitter finish. A tasty, balanced refreshing beer. Knocked a bit off for a slight skunkiness."

Had this in a bottle (would like to try it on tap though). Nice pleasing smell. Nice golden colour but head was quite small. Flavor was not huge but I liked the gentle bitterness of it.  Very refreshing and quite a light drink as well. This beer could have been a bit more flavorsome and alas as this beer is one of the most influential I can see where it influenced many of the tasteless beers around today. Still pretty good though.
"Tap at the Malt House - Pours a light amber, clear with a nice white head. Smells slightly yeasty, with some bready malt and light floral hops. Taste is bready with some slightly sweet, grassy hops when cold. Turns less bitter and more floral as it warms. Still fairly skunky, which is a big turn-off and why I’ve avoided this one in the bottle. It’s smooth, however, and a bit sweet with a dry, grassy finish. Decent."
"I have had this beer in bottle (bottle rating 2.0) and on tap, this rating is for the beer on tap.  Pours a medium yellow with little head and little lacing.  The taste is nicely ballanced between malt and hops.  The taste is crisp hops with a slight dry aftertaste.  If you can get this on draft enjoy, if you have to drink it out of a green bottle watch out for the skunk."
"Pours a dark straw colour, clear, with a white head. The aroma is of malt and hops. The taste is bitter with a long finish and strong carbonation. Overall a good pilsner beer."
"Traditional czech beer, very good to ordinary drinking. Great thing about that  - you can drink five or more glasses and it will taste same as you drinked first one :)"
"clear golden with carbobation and nice head. Aroma is malty and fruity with grassy hops. Flavour is sweet with bitter crisp finish,. leaving mouth little dry. Well balanced."
"50 cl can, Toronto, ON, Canada. Deep coppery golden colour, frothy head. Skunky resin aroma with some pepper. Crisp first sip, less flavor than anticipated that transitions to a mildly spicy finish."
"Pours golden with foamy white head.  Good carbonation.  Malty aroma with some hop aroma.  Taste is pilsner malt with nice, tangy bittering.  Light with medium body."
"bottle thanks to swalden28.  poured a yellowish gold with a white head.  aroma was slight citrus, grains, and wet paper.  flavor was slight citrus, very slight skunky grains, and cardboard with some slight hop bitter.  light body with high carbonation.  not offensive at all."
"This looks like a classic pub beer with a bit of head but not so much that you’ll get pissed at the bartender for handing you a pint of foam. Smells like light grains and popcorn, actually a very appetizing flavour on this one. Taste is excellent, a good mix of grains and hops, smooth syrupy mouthfeel but not too weird. A very good pilsner, one I’d seek out often."
A very clear golden beer with no head. The aroma is skunky. The taste is skunky. I would like to try this fresh(as I have heard it is good) but apparently none in America is fresh. It just does not make any sense for a brewery to ship green bottles across the ocean. If they know green bottles do not protect the beer & they are shipping quite a distance then why do it.  I guess they don not have anybody in these markets doing any quality control.
I need to retry this beer because the one i had was skunked. Horrible lager taste. Just bad.

Pours a pale golden color with a white head.Smells of floral hops and a little malt with a slight skunkyness.The flavor is a nice balance of piney hops and sweet malts.Body is light and the finnish is a little bitter.Overall a good beer I would buy again.
"Pours a golden yellow with a large white head. Aroma and taste is malts and hops... clean and crisp with a mild bitter aftertaste. I had a few of these, all on tap, in Cesky Krumlov. Maybe it was due more to the location than the beer itself but... I liked it. I can’t say I want to run out and buy one right now but when I am back in the beautiful Czech Republic I will be happy to have a few more."
"Good pilsner deserving of its reputation and popularity, if not a great beer.  dominated by hops and malt with some citrus as well."
I may have had a bad or mishandled bottle. The smell had a mercaptan level that rivals skunks--although it did not have a very predominant flavor when I drank it. Mostly tasted of resin with hay and cereal. Midway through the flavor the bitterness became really intense and lasted a long time. I think I need to try this again.
"12oz bottle.  Pours a bright clear golden yellow with a thick creamy white head.  A nice aroma of floral hops and a slight funkiness.  The taste is rather crisp and sharp. A floral and piney hops taste upfront, with a slightly sweet malt backdrop and some nice lemon spice.  Very refreshing and drinkable."
"Bottle. My late Opa from Germany turned me on to this beer. Even so, I really didn’t care for it. It is way too bitter for me. The color and aroma are not bad but after drinking it I really didn’t care to have another."
"Pours rich golden color with a thin yet lingering white head.
Aroma is that perfect round and full maltiness with a hint of caramelsweetness. Nice and smooth flavor, pleasing pilsner malt from the Bohemian and Moravian barley with a well balanced gentle Saaz hoppyness. The glass finishes quickly. This is the classic original that started it all for me. Czech it out."
"Golden colour, white creamy head. Aroma is grassy lots of malts and also some hops. Flavour is a lot more hoppy than the aroma lets on and it’s very nice. It rests on a soft malt background. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. This is a very good pilz a very unpretentious style ans sometimes not the most exciting, but sometimes it’s just the perfect style for the job"
"What can you say, there is a reason this is a classic beer. It has spicy, herbal hop aroma which is subtle with some malt character also detectable. Very refreshing with a lovely malt palate that is clean and very drnkable."
"I really think that I just had a bad batch.  The smell was horrible!  It was skunked big time.  However, the flavor wasn’t bad,  but it was just so hard to get that past that smell.  I’ll try it again soon and do a re-rate.
 Here’s my re-rate:  Poured perfectly clear with a nice white head that diminished rather quickly.  The aroma was rich with hops, floral, and a touch of fruit.  The flavor was crisp and bubbly on the tongue.  Initially, it was sweet followed by some nice cereal grains.  Then in the finish, the hops came out and it became nicely bitter.  Thi…"
"Pours crystal clear yellow with a thin active white head. Nose is grainy, skunk, bready with hints of noble floral hops. Flavor is hay, bread, yeast, mild sweet malts and bitter hops. Slight skunk flavor. Czech Pilseners are a favorite of mine. Good grocery store beer."
"Prauge-07. Great Pilsner, the one by which all others are judged! Has nice hop notes, and easy drinking. Still not near my favourite style of beer."
"Pours beautiful, rich golden color with nice white head & lacing. Excellent carbonation. Aroma is yeast  and hops with a slight metallic tinge. Crisp flavor that finishes clean. Was expecting something similar to Stella, but I believe this is better."
"on tap Prague, lovely gold color very malty and creamy, aroma of sweet spice and hops. This carries over to the taste with a hoppy finish that is just biiter enough to balance it all out. The only pilsner I really like."
"A very satisfying pilsner. Pours gold with a white head. Very skunky, grainy aroma, but the flavor pops with a nice balance of grainy malts and clean hops. A touch of sweetness adds a lot as well, but it finishes dry, as it should. Not the best pilsner, but a good, attainable, middle of the road example  to which compare all others to."
"From bottle and draft. Classcal pilsner. Golen color, grassy aroma. Good taste of hops. Classic."
"From 12 oz bottle in a Footed Pilsner at 45°.  Color is a deep gold with good carbonation and a nice white head.  Aroma is like skunky creamed corn.  Starting with a bolder light body it goes down smooth with a fizzy feel.  Finish of grain with a little hop flavor showing and a bold bitterness.  After taste is clean with a dry bitterness lingering on.  Overall its just ok, bitterness stands out better then most Pilsners I’ve had."
"One of my favorites.  Great aroma, nice full flavor.  I would disagree with other reviewers that it is hoppy, it could stand a stronger hop finish to balance."

"SUPREME. Clear, golden colour, floral hops aroma, extra fomay white head, a bit carbonated, when i ate with this beer, i actually enjoyed the beer most than the chicken tacos along, haha,.Semi oliy palate ,very drinkable.NIce!!"
"500ml can. Clear, light golden colored body with white head. OK bitterness."
"Bottle, 33 cl. Beautiful golden coloured beer with e madium white head. The smell is hoppy, the taste is hoppy, the aftertaste is hoppy as well. Strong beer, without any watery notes, certainly. Powerfull pils also. But pityfull, I didn’t really like the beer that much, I expected some more of ""the mother of all pilses"", brewed where the origin of pils lies."
"It poured a clear golden liquid with a big white foam that left big chunks on the side of the glass. It had a very weak smell of sweet malt and some grass. It had a fresh and crisp taste of sweet malt and bread. Watery with a light body. Smooth and nice mouthfeel. It was fresh and had no bad tastes but I would have loved just a hint of hops, now I couldn’t feel any at all. All in all a slightly above average lager. It worked well with the food though."
"citrus hoppy but stale aroma and taste. Not much to say. Grassy,grainy, bittersweet....Overly carbonated, hoppy dry finish."
"bottle, soft yellow/golden colour. Smell: very hoppy, like the taste and the aftertaste. It’s a bit overpowering beer. Not the ’ a beer please’ you would expect when you order a pils. Special!"
"500ml GREEN bottle.  Pours bright amber.  Immediate skunk aroma, maybe hoppy but I think the green bottle skunked it.  Very carbonated with a slightly acidic aftertaste.  I’m looking forward to getting this from a tap in Pilzen soon!"
"From the tap. Poured a golden yellow with a small bubbly head. Taste is dominated by crisp, grassy hops, yet nicely balanced. Tasty and well worth drinking more than one."
"50cl can. Very nice hops aroma, dry flavour. Bitter finish. Excellent pilsner, as it should taste."
Drank it for the first time on keg in the Czech Rep. The aroma consits out of nice Saaz hops. The taste is mainly about the hop and bitterness. As is wanted in a pilsner.
Pours a golden yellow.  Aroma of corn throughout.  A bit skunky with a dry and hoppy bitterness in taste.  Nothing special just a normal Czech pilsner.
"12oz bottle(poured into a 4 oz glass, not my fav style) picked this out for my first Czech beer. Pours pale no head just a white ring. high carbonation. Nose was as most pilsner’s are, all hops and very clean. Mine was a bit skunked as well(damn green bottles) Flavor was skunked. Very hoppy and bitter. still very  iron and water.
I’m sure this beer is much better on tap. I’ll drink again if i can get an un-skunked bottle.  but still not my style."
"Light gold in color with a nice whit head.  Aroma is biscuit, a little hops, some skunkiness.  Flavor is the same, biscuit, skunk.  Pretty decent beer.  Wish I could try it in a better bottle to lose some of that skunk."
"Aroma is a bit skunky.  Taste is a clean, crisp with a bitter aftertaste.  It’s hard to argue with the original."
"12 oz bottle.  Has a skunky, grainy aroma.  Pours a light amber color--much different than the American pale lagers that have tried to copy this beer for over 150 years.  Very little head.  Flavor is actually pretty bitter; grainy, wet dog aftertaste.  Tastes distinctly European.  Despite its flaws (skunk aroma, wet dog aftertaste) this is not a bad pilsener at all.  I can see why America’s brewing pioneers felt the need to copy it all those years ago.  If only they could have maintained the quality of this beer."
This is an excellent pilsener.  I had this one at Coast restaurant in Richmond.  The draft beer has so much going for it.  More hops than other pils  provide for a balanced bitterness.  This is the pilsener model for others to imitate.  The medium body beer has a smooth finish.  The color was deep gold with a modest head.
12 oz. Bottle. Pours a nice golden color. Small white head. Smells of malts and also a little bitter. Simliar tastes. A decent pilsner but not my favorite.
"Bottle. Moderate notes of grain and herbs for the malt and hops, light dough for the yeast with pepper, root vegetable and faint cardboard in the background. Head is small, frothy/fizzy, white with some lacing and is almost fully diminishing. Color is sparkling clear amber/gold. Flavor starts lightly sweet and acidic, then finishes lightly sweet, acidic and bitter. Palate is light to medium, watery with a lively carbonation. The finish is light in all aspects, but it’s perfectly balanced. It’s well known Bohemian Pilsener for a reason, and it proves the value of brewing tradition."
"500ml can poured into a pint glass. Poured a clear deep golden color with a 1"" head. As it was drank it produced some decent lacing. Aroma of bread, malts and some floral hops. Tastes sweet & bitter. Good balance or flavors. Good carbonation, crisp feel and a good hop bitter aftertaste. Very flavorful and easy to drink but best enjoyed slowly. Certainly one of my favorite Pilsners to drink."
"Finally back on tap at Cardinal. Clear, sparkling yellow liquid with a creamy white head. Aroma of flowers and toffee. Starts sweetly in the mouth but quickly evolves into moderate bitterness and a touch of sourness that carries through to the end. Feels dry, with a lively carbonation. Light to medium bodied. Always good!"
"Bitter. I’m just not big on Pilseners, because this is apparently the textbook example."
"500ml can. Can features this molded aluminum on the sides, raised to call attention to the logo design. Rather braille-y if you’re not ready for it. Pours a crystal clear pale gold. Mild, slightly sweaty, sweet corn nose. Flattish medium body. Corn nuts and corn on the mid-palate. Some dry grass there as well. Not much of an effort; alas, even the can couldn’t keep it anywhere close to fresh &#40AFAIK&#41."
"Aroma of rotting ingredients. Appearance of cat urine. Flavor of bitter nastiness probably due to the green bottles they’re shipped in. This beer might actually be enjoyable over in the Czech Republic, but by the time it gets to the states, I think that light has destroyed it. Overall this isn’t very good, and I won’t be drinking it again unless I’m in Prague someday."
The first time  I tried it I thought it was somewhat sour but this time around I got a better appreciation for it. I had a great smooth taste. Not too hoppy and not a hint of anything sour or tangy.
A bit different from other Czech-Slovak lagers. Rich bitter taste. Also quite strong. Very good after a game of football.
"Bottle.  Aroma of malt, hops, grass, straw, bread, and skunk.  Flavor follows suit, with some mild bitterness.  Light body, active carbonation, for a crisp palate.  Just a little bit better than those completely typical Euro macros; this one is so-so but totally overrated on here."
"&#40$1.79 16.9oz can @ Total Wine in Kennesaw, GA&#41.

Appearance: Pours a deep yellow body with a thick, though quickly diminishing white head. The cans are delightful. Gold, with an inlaid design.…"
"Dry bite bitterness resuliting in smooth caramel creaminess. Plenty of  malty hoppiness. Comes from tap  cold with  heavy white foam head, yet low on carbonation. Unpasteurised in Bohemia counts as one to drink all evening- in any case it’s sage not to switch to other beers in the same evening- they’ll taste over  syrupy / cidery on the palate. Refreshing, clean and almost no hangover, high purity / low chemicals.  Highly enjoyable at source. From a bottle, chill well, and it’s pretty good too."
"12 oz bottle.  Pours a nice golden color with a large white head. It has a crisp but skunky aroma. Tastes of biscuit, honey, flowers and pine. This strikes me as an outstanding beer. I really enjoyed it."
"&#40Draught&#41 Pours golden to light amber. Earthy and floral hop aroma with undertones of grass and herbs. Malt brings notes of bread and hints of toffee. Flavour starts with light sweet and clean malt, continues hoppy and dry with grass and herbs. Finish crisp, medium bitter and a bit oily. Light to medium body. Good and clean Pilsner."
"bottle, 0.5 L. drank this from the bottle. very refreshing indeed. slightly bitter, not sweet, not old. very fresh."
"&#40 12oz bottle&#41 Pours a very pale yellow with nice oily head with large bubbles. Bubbles continue to stick around after head dissipates, lacing is nice too. Aroma of honey, light bitter/crisp hops, orange zest, and grass. Quite complex for a ""staple"" beer. Taste is different than the nose, but really enjoyable. Crisp low hop presence increases the drinkability here, creamy body and finish, no bitter aftertaste. This is one solid pilsner and is so drinkable. You can even smell the yeast profile in this one somewhat, and drinks with a mild spiciness to it. A long description for a worthy…"
"Pours a nice deep clear gold with medium white head, minimal lacing.  Aroma of slight hops, decent bready malt, and grass.  Flavor matches well and is top notch in the world of pilsners.  Very refreshing and enjoyable."
"foamy white big head with an orange-amber body, smell is mineraly, woody. it tastes like a light biscuity malt, with salty dry taste. it is full tasting and a little pleasant biteyness. the 4.4 makes me sad but its a good beer"
"500 ml can from LCBO, served cold in a tulip glass. 



App.:  Fairly deep golden, clear with a night white froth.…"
"This chap came out of the bottle with a very nice amber colour along with the standard foamy white head, leaving a small amount of lacing.  Aroma was hoppily bitter, and enjoyable to inhale.  Taste was right there, and the mouthfeel was almost ’snappy’.  Aftertaste also a good ’un."
"What can I say?  Everyone’s had it and its special czech saaz hops - but it’s skunky out of the bottle if not really fresh, and much better on tap or even out of their cans."
bottle.  Pours a clear golden with a white head.  Nose is SKUNKY.  Thank you for putting it in green bottles so it could be ruined.  Grain and bread in the aroma as well.  Taste is better.  Bready malt and a bit sweet.  Mouthfeel is thin.
"Crystal clear golden pour, nice head showing some persistence.
Aroma is a mix of skunk, grainy/biscuity sweet malt and noble hops.
Flavours are a bit better, with lots of bready/biscuity malt, honey, green hoppy notes and an assertive bitterness.…"
"Clear straw colored body, medium white head, and no lacing. Smells of stale gym socks with some lemon and malt. Taste has some notes of nutrasweet and a medium amount of hops. Hard to get over the offensive odor. Not completely undrinkable but probably won’t buy again, then again, I may have gotten a bad bottle."
"Bottle: Pours a foamy white head fades quickly. The lacing is minimal, the aroma is similar to others of the style with typical skunking. This is a smooth and soft beer."
"Good quality beer, nice to have at any time, everybody can have it, doesnt matter if they are beer lovers or not"
"Bottle 50cl. Golden beer with a medium white head. Intensive and very nice hops aroma. This pilsner has a nice body, sweet and also malt flavour. The finish is bitter and herbal, a very good beer."
This brew has excellent flavor and appearance.  Big head and strong hops aroma.  Great tasting beer for any occasion.
"bottle-not my favorite style, straw color, saaz hop aroma, very light, not flavorful...-re rate, 8/4/09- completely wrong about this beer and could not appreciate pilsners at the time- a terrific example of the style, bursting with hop flavor and sufficient bitterness- drinkable and yet, superior flavor. Nice."
One of a kind taste.  Flavor lingers for a long time.  It’s a great thirst quencher on a hot day.
"golden Pilsner, a minimal head when poured into mug, medium sweetness and body, average carbonation.  First actual quality beer ever had.  Definitely enjoyed it."
"Regular bottles in São Paulo (Brazil), some others in Prague, Brno and also in Plzen (Urquell’s hometown) - a refreshing beer... with hoppy aroma and taste... an ""easy-to-drink"" beer... nothing spectacular... but ok to have it."
"1 lite stein in Prague. I’ve had this from bottles and it’s not the same. A delightfully refreshing golden Pilsner. Clean and crisp with no hint of adjunct ingredients. Pleasantly hoppy aroma and flavour. Personally I find this very moreish, although it’s not as complex as the unfiltered version available at the brewery- which I would like to see on wider release."
16.9 oz can.  Light golden color.  Aroma is of barley malts and sweeter hops.  Taste has a bit more hops than I was expecting.  There’s kind of a wheat flavor as well.   Leaves a pleasant bite in the end.  An overall much more decent brew than I was expecting.
"Clear gold with thin white head.  Mild malty aroma.  Bitter taste and finish, decent body.  Not bad.  Better on draught."
"Out of bottle, very bitter, not too appealing, bland and cardboard like in flavor."
bottle.  golden pilsener - definite skunk taste - similar to many mass produced beer - not really worth rating but will.
"Bottle. Pours a clear golden color with a medium sized frothy white head. Aroma of grass, malt, and hops. Flavor is very good, just slightly marred by the slight skunky flavor."
"The pilsener measuring stick! Wonderful gold in color light white head. Of all the macros I used to drink, this is one of the few I still drink."
"Pours a beautiful golden colr with a medium head. Aromas of grass, malt and slight skunk. A wonderful balance of malt and Saaz hops on the palate. Nice crisp and dry finish that makes you want more. This is my favorite pilsner and probably one of my top 20 favorite beers of all time."
(bottle). Clear golden color. Small white head. Light malty/skunky aroma. Light malt flavor with lemon and bitterness. Avg duration. Sligthly astringent finish. Thin/fizzy texture. Moderate carbonation. Spare lacing.
"Appearance: lovely golden orange with no visible carbonation and a small white head. Aroma: slight grass, some yeast, wheat, fresh corn. Flavour: tasty fresh grass, wheat. Sharp crisp bite with a lovely dry finish. I’m very surprised."
"The original and possibly the best. Really refreshing, nice low ABV and very well priced.  For me this is the best drink to be served cold on a hot day."
"(draught 0,5l)
Clear golden color. Medium white head. Light hops aroma. Medium bitternes. Bitter finish."
Aroma of hops and malt. Flavor of hops. Medium bitterness. It’s refreshing.
"On tap. Pours deep golden with a generous creamy white head. Malty aroma, grass.
Nice malty flavour and quiet a bit of Saaz hops blended nice together."
Pours golden with a white head. Nose is skunky.  Perfect level of hop taste for a pils with a faint note of malt. The source of imitation for all American macro lagers; they all pale in comparison to the original.
33cl bottle poured into a footed pilsner.  Sparkling straw with quite a bit of fizzy white head.  Aroma is skunky hops.  Flavor is very hoppy.  Finish is long and bitter.  Not horrible but not great.
"Pours standard off gold lager, white foamy head.  Taste is sharply hoppy, sweet malty and vegetable-like, with a moderate carbonation.  Finishes fairly bitter dry hops.  Nice lager."
"To me, this beer is delicious.  It seems thicker than other pilsners, giving it an aura of substance and a great sense of value.  It has a perfectly balanced hop-flavor to hop-bitterness taste.  It also has a decidedly European taste to it, relaying a hint of dusty cobblestoned streets and of sweaty non-airconditioned Europeans themselves (This could be real or an imagination, but nonetheless it’s there).  If I were forced, God forbid, to choose one beer to drink everyday for the rest of my life, this might have to be the choice - it’s well balanced, and I like to live by the Golden Mean."
"Not gonna blow anyone away...light gold in color decent white head, slight hop aroma with alittle sweetness of the yeast. lightly hopped flavor, with some citrusy maybe lemon and light malts - very crisp. bitter finish. Best pilsner I’ve come across - that’s not saying much..."
"Light golden colour with a distinct but weak aroma. Head retention is fairly low, with little lacing. Nice malty taste, with a refreshing, underlying bitterness."
"pours an dark golden color, with a little head that is white.  the aroma is of malt and hops, alittle yeast.  the taste is malty with a nice bitterness in it. its more watery that anything.  overall an ok pilsner"
"Very light, but decent flavor.  Pretty much nothing in the aroma department."
"Yellow clear fizzy, with a white head. Aroma is yeasty and malty, a bit skunky. Flavor is of malt and has a light hop bitterness. Medium-light body. A good brew for using a 167 year old recipe."
"Pours a tall foamy white head.  Golden color.  Fragrant aroma...floral, malt & hops.  Refreshing, light mouthfeel, some malt and a nice hop presence that starts at the front and lingers all the way through to the aftertaste, much like you’d expect in a good pilsener.  I’ve always liked this one; one of my favorite pilseners."
"Skunky aroma with just a bit of lemon. Flavor is a little less skunk, some hop bitterness, and more lemon but really, very little flavor."
Pretty big and lemony aromas light hops. A nice big cereal hit. Crisp and refreshing with some hops to finish.  Not super lovely but obviously better than most easily accessible beers.
"Light gold beer with really nice malt and hop flavour. So much better than anything Lion Nathan or CUB could ever produce. These brewers give Australian beer such a bad name so I have to seek out wonderous beer such as this.  A pity really, but the reality of beer making in general in Australia."
"Bottle. Classic beer. Wish I could have had it when fresh, rather than having traveled from the other side of the world... At least it’s not being made by Fosters or Lion at least...
Nice golden colour with good long lasting head & good lacing. Nice aroma of noble hops & malty aromas too. Flavour is malty, noticeable diacetyl (but apppropraite for style), good bitterness, very moreish."
"Very light blond beer with a weak head. Interesting smell.. smells basically like old urine...
Yeasty taste with serious hoppiness and a brrrrr bitterness at the end which is so overwhelming it’s actually quite nice :-) The aftertaste is surprisingly smooth with the bitterness disipating into refreshing grainy wateriness."
"Tap at Yard House Scottsdale.  God I hate that chain when it’s not happy hour.  Faintly peppery and yeasty in nose - body is a floury gold with minimal head.  Flavors feature floury ’lager’ taste (but distinctly European like Budvar), nice German grain quality, stays light and finishes quickly.  World classic."
"On tap at Giordano’s pizza.  Smelled and tasted oddly exactly like something that we couldn’t place for about 5 minutes... then, FRESH CORN TORTILLAS.  THIS IS INSANE THIS IS INSANE THIS IS INSANE.  Very drinkable with only the slightest bitterness."
"(tap in Praha) A clear, golden beer woth thick white foam with a tint of yellow. Aroma was very low. Taste was good, nice malty sweetness with some bitterness. The mouthfeel was fitting and the aftertaste had a balanced bitterness and sweetness."
"On tap. Effervescent gold with a white head, abundant lace. Floral aroma with a light honey sweetness. Flavor like liquefied fresh bread, slightly sweet, quite dry. Light to medium body with a very refreshing, crisp mouthfeel."
From bottle. Crisp dry and refreshing. Palate very light. somewhat one dimensional. was a bit dissapointed
"Bottle.  Pours a very pale amber color with a small off-white head.  A crisp, grainy, corny, grassy aroma.  Thin to medium-bodied.  The flavor starts off with some lightly sweet maltiness and corn.  Finishes crisp, kinda wheaty, and a tad drying.  An underlying skunky quality and hints of lemons throughout.  Lame style.  Refreshing and clean, at least."
Draft. Multiple tastings. It’s OK but I would rather go to Czech and taste it at the brewery.
"Bottle. Enjoyed many times, but finally rating. Mild grassy pilsner hops, mildly sweet, slight grain, and pretty metallic, though still pretty damn good. Light palate. Solid summer drinker."
Can. Pours solid gold with white head that fades quickly.  Mild citrus aroma.  Little sweet with a hint of bitterness.  Pretty light bodied and lively on the tongue with a long bitter finish.
"Pours luminous amber with hint of gold and thick white head. Nose is fresh with citrus hops, and some pine. Palate offers a nice balance of malt with hop bitterness that yields an amazingly drinkable ale that leans to the hoppy side of things. Medium bodied."
"Pours a golden clearish color with a small white head. Aroma is malt, touch of hops, and a little grass. Flavor is grass, malt, touch of hops, skink. Easy to drink and refreshing and clean. Decent Pils."
"Bottle. A clear medium to dark golden beer with a small and fast disappearing white head. The aroma is quite weak, lightly malty, with some hoppiness and notes of frass, and some boiled vegetables. A bit skunky. The flavour has a medium sweetness and some notes of grass and herbs. Medium body, lively carbonatiuon, dry medium finish with medium bitterness. I used to like this beer, but everytime I retaste, it seems to me that is making worse. However more than drinkable."
"12 oz. bottle.  Pours a golden color with a decent white head which dissipates quickly.  Aroma of malts and yeast hit you immediately w/ pour, dare I say even a little macro skunk, but it fades rather quickly.  Not overly carbonated.  Goes down fairly easy.  Light bodied.  More refreshing than anything."
"Bottle.  Golden with moderate head.  Has some hoppy bite, and overall flavor well balanced, with pronounced pilsner bitterness.   Very solid choice."
Gold-yellow colour with white head. Pretty nice taste but overestimated I think. There are a lot better czech beers than this one.
Clear gold pour. Fizzy white head and rather thin in the lace department. Clean refreshing. Thin bodied notable hints of hops...it is what it is...
"light aroma little bit of butter, ok, appearance is a dirty yellow, flavor malt body with low but long bitterness, strong carbonation"
12 oz bottle.  Pours clear golden with a medium white head.  Aroma is mildly sweet biscuit with a hint of bitter hops.  Flavor is fairly dry with biscuit and honey.  Hops come across as slightly metallic but grow much more citrusy as it warms.  A solid pilsener.
Draft - Golden yellow color with a disappearing white head. Malty flavor with notes of hops and citrus. Flavor is malty with nice hoppy bitterness. One of the best macrobreweries!
"I would rate this higher if it was more consistent.  I spent a summer in Prague, drank this a lot, and never tired of ; however, here in the states I’ve had good pints/bottles that remind me of that summer, and skunked-out bottles that I regret buying immediately. If it’s a good bottle, this is a great Pilsner with a unique taste that most other popular Pilsners pale in comparison to."
"Poured a clear golden yellow with a 1"" white head that went down quickly. There were quite a few carbonation bubbles rising in the glass. The aroma was a mild malt one. The initial taste was good and crisp with lots of carbonation. There was a slight hops bite and a little sweetness there too. The mild hops bite lasted onto the finish and was refreshing."
"3,09$ for a 500ml can.  I would rather have it on tap or in bottle.  Metallic notes detected either by my tastebuds or my prejudiced brain towards cans.  Very floral aroma, almost intriguing.  Dominant notes of apple comes out first, almost like a cider but the moderate hop bitterness comes next to remind that this is a beer.  Very enjoyable but I think I prefer Czechvar (Budvar) a little more, more crisp and less ""applely"".  These are the only Czech pilseners available in Québec’s imaginary country (I hope I’m wrong)."
"Pours tawny, golden that leaves lacing. Aroma has tinge of apple. Clean flavor with lean body and lasting hop finish."
"Similar to Holland beer. A bit skunky but about what you would expect. It really is worth a sampling if you are sick of your ""regular"" brew."
"Gold body and white head. sweet hops aroma. Hops flavor, bitter. Crisp and dry finish. A Good Pilsner."
"Bottle. Out of the over-priced, imported pilsener, this one takes the cake. It has more character than Beck’s, Heiniken or Stella. Slight hop bite. Refreshing."
"Holy smokes!!!!  This must be Blatz’ long lost European cousin.  Nice flavor, distint hops aroma.  I could see getting lit up like an Xmas tree on this, and then passing out on the neighbors lawn.  But, why oh why would ANYONE put beer into green bottles?  Especially the Czechs!  They should be ashamed."
"A pretty basic beer. Its not bad for what it is going for, but it is quite forgettable."
"33 bottle. Pours the usual golden color. Rather clean, refreshing and lightly hoppy brew with some light traces of butterscotch and some herbs and a nice bitterness. One of the better standard beers from Czech Republic. I would like to taste the unfiltered version ..."
"Overall Impression: 
One of those beer that everyone has had, that just OK, and not much more...…"
Draft. Decent aroma with a crisp hinting at the nose. Decent look with a lot of carbonation and big head. Flavor is good and mild with a smooth and clean mouthfeel. Good pilsner.
"Aroma is initially skunky, then a combination of lemony hops and grainy malt.  Flavor is also lightly hopped, and balanced with malt and a slightly bitter finish.  May be the original, but definitely not the best.  Somewhat unique, but a mass-produced character overall."
"500ml can.  Pours a beautiful golden color.  The head doesn’t last too long, but that doesn’t matter....this is one damn good pilsner.  It’s a damn shame I wasn’t old enough to drink when I visited the Czech Republic."
"Entirely forgettable, but not horrible.  Rather bland, perhaps a hint of apple taste if anything."
"(bottle) clear golden colour, stable white head. simple, but inviting aroma of fresh malts and grassy, floral hops. flavour is sweet, honey-tinged pale malts, spicy floral hops, light notes of peaches, banana and a hint of butter, very harmonious. medium carbonation, light to medium body, light bitter finish. the best macro out there."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle.  Nice golden color, relatively translucent.  Smell isn’t overpowering, but is pleasant.  I taste rice and corn which gets taken over by a decent hoppy bite before fading back into a corn/rice finish.  I’d say it’s pretty middle of the road, but enjoyable."
"Bottle. Gold yellow pour with a white head. Smells of skunk awfulness. Taste is light wheat but mainly that same skunk awfulness. Fizzy, and generally displeasing."
Pours smoothly to a fine white head. Slightly fruity aroma. Taste is strong but not bitter with no aftertaste.
I know this is the Czech beer that you can find anywhere and it tastes like it.  A rough drink around the edges.  NOthing refined here.
"Unpastuerized (but still filtered) from tap at U Zlatého Tygra in Prague.  Fresh, vibrant, crisp, wet, hoppy, then dry, grassy, slick, refreshing, etc.  Really an amazing beer when had fresh.  A few notches below the unfiltered (and wood) versions, and above the bottled version we get in the US, but to be honest, if you can get a fresh case of this in the US, cans or bottles, it can be spectacular... fresh, dusty, pungent, firm, full body, it’s awesome.  Fresh bottles score in the 3.7-4.0 range, while old bottles can be as low as 2.5-2.8.  Hey, if you’re buying this from the singles shelf chances are you’r…"
golden in color with white head aromas of skunk due to bottle color and maybe not being fresh taste of skunk
"Golden with a huge, rocky head.  Light earth and some hops in the aroma.  Flavor is earthy hop, light malts, and a semi-dry, bitter finish.  What a difference from the bottled version.  An outstanding pilsener that I’m looking forward to drinking again.  Rating reflects draught version.  (Draught at Pivo, Yokohama)…"
"This was the only beer my dad would ever buy, and I hated it. Then I started drinking beer and can now appreciate it. 

For some really strange reason, I think it smells and tastes like Chicken soup tho. Beautiful golden color, strong head, and crisp, although short-lived taste."
"Pours golden yellow color with white head. Floral hops and malty aroma. Malty with a nice, crisp bitter hop finish. Medium body with lively carbonition. Very refreshing. An excellent pilsner. I’d love to try this fresh from the source."
"Can, draught, bottle, you name it. Golden color, white head. Hoppy aroma. Smooth bitter flavor with some grapefruit and a touch of biscuity malts and a slightly dry finish. Medium-high carbonation, medium body. A good pilsener."
"Bottle.  Pours a golden color, not as light yellow as a lot of Pilsners, with a fluffy decently retained white head.  Very clear.  Aroma shows Pilsner malt and mild lager yeast characteristics.  No skunk, thankfully.  Typical Pilsner aroma thus far, pretty decent actually.  Flavor is super clean, mildly malty with low bitterness.  Dry with a quick finish. Quaffable as hell.  This is all right, really.  I prefer a German Pils but this is not bad at all."
"This is a beer that i must have had a few 100 times but just never rated, had to get 6 because this got me a free glass. Pleasently suprised everytime with this fellow. Aroma is fairly full, with the hops different from the type im used too. Taste is also quite full with a good amount of bitterness and dry, very sessionable beer here. RERATE: Numerous bottles while walking home and on tap at the ragalah. Alround rating: Biscuity buttery malts, creamy if you will, grassy floral hop with some tangarine line skin oil subtkly there too, lots of bitterness. Alround an excellent drink."
"Boy, I’m kind of shocked by all the low ratings.  It seems that if a beer has lower than 6% ABV it’s going to get a low rating on this site.  I judged this one against others of its style.  I’m not a huge pils fan but this is probably among the best of the style.  I will admit that I have gotten some pretty skunky ones in this country but in Europe I’ve found them quite drinkable.  Obviously if you sip this after a Belgium trippel its beer water but against other pils’ it definitely holds its own.  If you dont like it get a fresh one, if you still don’t like it get another style."
"[Look]: Deep golden color with a nice head.
[Smell]: Very spicy nose, nice dry maltiness, hint of fruity and honey.
[Taste]: Spicy and floral hops, biscuity, hint of roasted honey.  Light to medium bodied. Very crisp and dry finish.…"
"Apperance; Light yello, almost no sparkling and head. Aroma; Some fruits and hops, and medium bitterness at the end. ok pilsner."
On tap at The Irish Pub(nyc). The only word I can think of to describe Pilsener urquell is SMOOTH. This is the smoothest beer i’ve ever had. Needless to say it goes down easy. Pleasant taste(slightly sweet) and crisp finish.
Hefty bitter after taste that lingers for awhile.  Not my favorite and I would probably choose water over this if offered.
"Draught. Golden colour with a small white head. Hoppy nose with some malts. Grassy hops, buttery, malts and bitterness. Medium-bodied and some bitterness in the aftertaste. Very good and refreshing pilsener."
"bottle, pours light gold with a white head.  Aroma is lightly hoppy with a slight skunk.  Soft mouth with an almost creamy body.  Sweet light malt body with a hoppy finish that ends on the dry side and begs for another sip.  Delicate and refreshing."
Bottle. Pours a yellow with no head. Very weak aroma of malts and skunk. Very light body. Very easy to drink. Ok beer.
"Golden Yellow Pour. No head at all. Lots of flavor in this one for a lighter brew. Refreshing, and clean tasting. smelled like a skunked beer, but i think thats just the style, i think it is the saaz hops but im not sure. thin to med mouthfeel.
Overall just an okay brew for me, not a fan of the style."
"On tap at the Flying Saucer in KC. Pours a see-through golden body with a good amount of rising carbonation. Finger-width, white, dense head that remains on the surface throughout the session with minimal lacing. Aroma is mainly toffee malts with an even amount of grainy European hops. Flavor is very standard to the style, but this seems to have a much fresher taste than most other pils. A little maltier than other pils, giving this a bit of a fuller body. Refreshing, smooth, and lightly spiced. Some grassy hop bite to it with no real aftertaste except for a hint of sweet maltiness. Overall, the…"
"It pours and looks like a regular commercial beer, mass produced and boring. But as it gets close to your nose you realize theres something hiding in the flavour. The smell is very hoppy and the taste is nice and smooth. It finishes strong with a nice hop flavour."
"From 330 ml bottle. Pours clear gold with a tall white head. Comlex aroma , pretty skunky. Flavour has lots of saaz hops perfectly melded with the malt. The flavor is perfect bitter and crisp the original pilsner . Its the standard."
"500 mL can. Pours a yellow gold with a 2-finger foamy white head that doesn’t particularly last long but leaves some lace on the sides as it is sipped. The aroma is light malt and hops with a hint of yeast and the typical skunkiness of Euro beers. The malt and hops balance well with a mild nutty overtone. The hops come through in the aftertaste but not too overpowering, ending in a somewhat nutty finish. Actually, it tastes better than it smells. I’ll never say no to this one."
Golden pour  with a fine white head.aroma of Saaz hops. i’m not a big lager drinker but if this one is on tap i will have one
"12oz. drank in Czech Republic & also Germany. Pours yellow, lots of carbonation in the white head. Malty, with that (what I like to call) ""typical"" skunkiness of Western European light beers. I can’t really say that this beer is superior to any other, but it holds a special place in my heart. Everytime I see a bottle of Urquell, I’ll be transported back to Prague and the great times I had there. Just for that simple fact, I’ll give this beer a thumbs up."
"Bottle.  A sentimental favorite of mine.  Pours a yellow gold color, and a medium white head.  Aroma is mild mats and toffee, but mostly hops.  Taste is classic, this is the definitive beer of a whole category of modern beers.  A great hoppy bite throughout and a clean taste throughout."
"Bottle.  Had this one in 06.  Poured gold with a fizzy white head.  Smells of malts and light hops, slighly skunky.  Tasted very crisp, with lots of grain malts, some corn, and a nice balance of bittering hops.  Pretty good beer."
My favorite Pilsner.  Early taste of grain and hops.  Finishes bitter with a sharp whack to the palate.  Great.
"I drank this a hundred times, as it is the standard beer in many Prague restaurants. Deep golden yellow, nice head. Hoppy and slightly malty. Nothing special to notice, but quite decent, although not one of my favourite Czech beers.
**************
re-rate: bottled and tankovna Plzen on tap at Hotel Zvon, Ceske Budejovice:…"
"The original Pilsner is still a contender. It begins with Saaz hop, malt, and apple notes in the aroma.  Beautiful pale amber color, crystalline in appearance, with a light but firm head.  The hops hit up front but do not linger, then the pale malt takes over.  Apple-like tartness lingers in the finish.  Warning: this beer lends itself to session drinking if you’re not careful!"
"A re-rate- Sparkling gold with a frothy white cap. Floral saaz nose with grass, some spice, a bit of straw, pale malts. Tastes of floral hops, grains, some sweet fruit. A well crafted pils that is a weekly drinker for me. Medium carbonation, marked bitterness. Nice beer."
"Bottled. Golden with a fine white head. Aroma: Initial strong hop aroma Flavor: smooth slight hop that transitions into bitter, then slightly tart flavor."
"(500ml bottle, Tesco’s) Poured a golden colour with many fast bubbles rising to the clean white head at the top. Smell of Saaz hops but lacked any skunkiness that cheaper pilsners get. Taste was a big flavour bomb that I wasn’t expecting from a lager, great hop presence and a nice biter finish. Not a huge number of flavours in there but the ones it has it does very well. Not overly carbonated, and never watery, this was a really refreshing, nice lager. I’d choose this over any other pilsner no doubt. Great."
"Pours a orangey yellow with lots of fine carbonation and a small head that never really disappears. Aroma is of saaz hops, oily smell with apples, floral almost cologne smell, citrus, and some mustiness. Tastes fairly oily, apples, honey, citrus, a little corn, and a earthy lightly bitter finish. Mouth feel is really good, oily, nice full but small bubbles in the carbonation. Nice, defiantly the benchmark of all pilsners."
Pilsner Urquel poured clear and gold with little head.  It’s aroma is of malt and floral hops.  It had a great presence on the palate with nice contest between the malts and hops with the hops winning out in the end. Refreshing and very drinkable.
"This is my favorite. This was my gateway beer to drinking better beer, and I will always be grateful for that. I have had beers that knocked my socks off with their hoppiness, but I have never found one that can replace this as my fave. Wonderful hop flavor, not too overpowering, smooth as can be and drinkability that is unsurpassed. I reccomend this beer to all my beerdrinking friends. I have yet to have anyone not like it."
"A Mes rate: Draught at the Ranelagh.
Lovely dark gold colour with an excellent white head and some great condition in it. Adding to the appearance score is the awesome glass.  All too often this never reaches us folks in the UK fresh enough. However, when it is good, like the little girl with the curl, it is very very good. Slight sulfur in the nose with some excellent fruity hoppage just behind it. awesome fresh hoppy flavour with some utterly glorious pale malt and just the right amount of bitterness in the finish. The fruity notes are easily…"
"spicy hop and a touch of honey aroma. Great appearance - rich gold with a pillowy head. A touch of corn and honey flavour, then the hop spice kicks in. A semi-sweet, pleasant apple-juice tang matched by an assertive bitterness to finish."
"Very thin head, with a great aftertaste that is slightly bitter yet a crisp cool and refreshing taste. Not bad for a fairly large produced commercial beer"
"a- pours a crystal clear, light golden hue with a medium, white, creamy head that is mostly diminishing, minimal lacing

s- nose is light and refreshing, clean malts well balanced with the Czech malts, tones of grain and corn…"
"When they say this is the meter that all other pilseners are held to, they aren’t kidding.  This is truly exceptional."
"Poured from 12oz. bottle into pint glass.
Aroma - malt, carmel, and grassy hops.
Appearance - Golden in color with 1 finger white head. Nice lacing on glass.
Flavor - Nice light carmel malt flavor upfront with Saaz hops on the finish…"
"on tap in Prague, Rating is for Draught in ’tankova’ pubs, unpasturised and fresh makes a big difference, great hop finish"
"Nice blond clear pils, the pils of pilsen great taesty hop flavor and nice low body. A pils that is asking for more."
"The CEO of SABMiller calls this his favorite beer. Weird that a beer company would have a CEO that didn’t know jack about beer. If this is your favorite beer then you are NOT a beer drinker. That said, it isn’t terrible.  Pale golden color with average white head.  Grassy hop and sweet malt on the aroma.  Same on the taste, a little artificial-tasting.  Crisp but a tad watery.  It’s the ""Steve Urquell"" of beers (take that however you will)."
"12 oz bottle.  Poured a clear golden/yellow color with a one finger white head.  The aroma was very floral.  The flavor was a bit skunky, but not too bad.  A good bitter finish."
"31.01.2009, 0,5l Can. Pale yellow colour. No head. Aroma is flowers and hops. hoppy aftertaste."
"Pours with a dark golden hue with no head whatsoever. Hue is pretty clear - some carbonation bubbles but not much.
Aroma is of fruits, hops, and yeast. There is a slight barley note, that comes in pretty strong. 
Flavor has a bready beginning, and a slightly hoppy ending - Saaz Hops in particular…"
"Hmmm.  Maybe not all beer in green bottles is bad.  This one had some very nice hoppy notes to it, along with some nice citrus notes.  I was pleased with what I found in this beer."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this pilsner. The bottle is completely unassuming, with mediocre design and green glass. I was expecting an average European beer with a funk to it. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pilsner glass. Yellow body, with a slight head. Smells slightly skunky, with grass and malt aromas. The taste, however, is anything but skunky. Extremly smooth, refreshing beer. Light malt taste with a hint of hops bitterness at the end that warms the mouth rather than biting. Fantastic pilsner. I will be buying in the future."
Golden yellow in color with a medium sized white head. Aroma is of light strawor grass and malts. Light malt snd grain taste with light hops.
"warm yellow body under an average head. Smell of string grasses and flowers. Wonderful soft malt taste, dry and hoopy but not sharp. Slightly bitter finish. Beautiful. Palate watery and only a touch fizzy.  Nice to go with an original for my 100th rating."
"330 mL. This is probably right in between a crappy beer and a good beer...it is a diving line between two beer realms. Pours a clear light yellow with a white head that disappears. Aroma of cereal grain, Saaz hops, skunky pale malt. Taste is watery up front and then turns surprisingly bitter and dry from the Saaz hops to the point of almost being metallic. I like the sharp bite in this beer and is a good bar choice when nothing else is on tap."
"Draft in pilsner urquell glass. Poured translucent golden amber with a thin ring of white head. Aroma was sweet and mellifluous, subltey fruity , and slightly citric noble hop finish. Flavor was similar, the pilsner malt handled much better than in most others and this did not taste like cereal rather almost like a vienna malt, apple, leafy hop bitterness accentuated by carbonation gives a bite at the end. The palate was excellent, fuller than any macro pilsner I suspect because a slight resinous qualty is left on the tongue by the noble hops, and there was certainly no watering down or…"
"Pours a Golden hue with a white head that fades away very fast. No lacing to speak of. 

Aroma of baked bread and just a slight noble variety hops.…"
"Bottle. Clear golden in colour with noticeable carbonation and a tiny bubbly white head. Floral hop aromas with subtle fruity malt notes. Plenty of bitterness that cascades to its climax before ending on a very nice hoppy finish. Despite the fizzy appearance, the mouthfeel is full and soft."
Vanilla and creamy malt on the nose with a touch of herbal hop character. More herbal and peppery hop notes on the palate that finishes quite dry. the malt body is solid and a touch creamy/buttery. I’m thinking pilgrimage when i drink this!
"Bottle and draft.  Pours a pale golden body with a white head.  Light earthy grassy hop nose, apple skins, floral notes.  Thin and crisp with a signature bitter finish."
"On tap Germany. Not a pils fan but this is great stuff. Of course, this beer defines pilsner. Simply incredible beer. The bubbles seem to dance to the top of the glass. The hop/malt balance comes out on the side of the hops, and it’s just perfect. Golden, clear, lively. A super beer!"
"This beer has a distinct apple aroma to me. It remains one of my favorite pilseners, as it has a nice lift to it and is not at all funky. I can’t believe I’ve never rated this. Great beer, especially considering that you can often find it in bars."
"Aug 1, 2006  
This is one of my mainstream favorites, enjoyed recently on London trip in Chelsea, but have also drank in Praha. Very refreshing and not too strong. Clean."
Pours to a golden hue.  Foamy head rhat disappears quicly.  Taste of lemon and honey with a strong but pleasant aftertaste.  One I look forward to having.
"Canned. Dark yellow/golden clear body, thick cloudy white head. Yeast in the aroma, some sour fruit. Grapes? Dishrag is a good description. The taste is better, with lemon, hops. Honey?"
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a white head.  Aroma of lemon an dyeast.  Smooth flavor of lemon, yeast, and some malts.  Very nice for a pilsner."
"On tap at Oldsmar Tap House. Clear bright golden hue, very thick creamy white head and sticky braids of lacing. Hoppy sticky malt nose, some wheat, corn and sweet fruit. Very sensual flavors, tasty, hops and some lovely fresh malts come through eventually. Crisp, very tasty. Could drink the fuck out of this one"
"Pours nice golden color with a pillowy white head. Aroma is initially a little skunky, but that gives way to sweet malt, and grain. Nice sweet and crisp flavor, some corn and grain. Nice pilsner, enjoyable to drink."
"Speaking as someone constantly bombarded by ads for every macro beer out there, this is definitely the beer that they all WISH they were anything like. Such an amazingly smooth, drinkable, and delicious pilsner! Bitter Saazy finish and aftertaste that’s amazing, definitely some good hops in this one!  Delicious malt backbone. Very bready and tasty. One of those beers that tastes just as good if not a little better when it’s warmer. I love it! An essential classic that is grossly under rated on this site. Seriously."
NICE GOLDEN COLOR WITH A NICE FOAMY HEAD. A NICE GERMAN PILSNER WITH A STRONG BITTER AFTERTASTE. IT IS JUST AN AVERAGE BEER A LITTLE PRICEY.
"What else needs to be said about this brew other than it is a classic.  Really good looking after it pours, a dark golden effervesent.  Very complex in flavor, piney bitterness that gives way to a slight vanilla flavor.  Slight skunkyness in aroma finally gives way to a sweet malt scent.  Overall, its a classic."
"clear golden color with good lacing, moderate to high carbonation.  starts with a crisp hoppiness and finishes clean.  flavor is grapefruit, with a touch of spruce.
a nice lighter beer that has some edge to it."
"Bottle 50cl. Pours a golden coloured brew with fluffy white head. Slightly grainy, hoppy and somehow a hint of wooden taste. Champagne-like carbonisation. Very drinkable and indeed a classic."
"Pours clear pale yellow with a couple fingers of white head. Aroma initially quite skunky, then as that dissipates there is some honeyish sweetness, sourish dishrag and strangely, mint. Mouthfeel smoothish but lightly prickly. Some nice rings of lacing. Flavor is very light sweetish honey, corn, paper and cereal, along with a bit of a sour twang and mint. Could write this off as just another bad pale lager experience except for a noticeable light hoppy bitter bite in finish with a bit of a bitter aftertaste. Bottle from Rum Runner."
Pours golden with lasting white head. Very malty and flowery nose from the Saaz hops. Flavour is fruity and the perfect balance of pale malt. Perhaps the best session beer around. There’s nothing like enjoying a few of these on the Bohemian homeland.
[bottle] Pours a light golden color with a decent sized white head. Very good hoppy aroma. Initial taste of hops that gave way in time to a malty finish. Reminds me a bit of Heineken without the disgusting skunk taste.
Can. Weak malt aroma. Beatiful clear yellow colour with white head. Rich carbonation. Slightly bitter. Quite uncomplicated and refreshing.
"cereal, light sweet citrus aroma,golden, clear, white foam, first is medium sweetnes than medium bitter,medium body, long finish, bitter, still good czech premium lager"
"Golden see-through yellow with a low white head leaving light lace behind.  Slight hop aroma combined with malts leaves a pepperoni like aroma in the nose.  Medium body with a spicy, meaty, sun-dried tomatoe flavor and dry malty spice to the finish.  Nice pilsner. 500ml bottle purchased in NRW Germany."
This ancestoric and very classic pils has a nice white head and a hoppy aroma. Golden colour. The flavour is bright and malty. Crisp taste and a long bitter aftertaste. A must for all fans of the pils style.
"Pours a very light yellow with a small and quickly diminishing head. 
Aromas of freshly cut grass, lime and herbs. A fruity pilsner with flavors of apple, citrus, coriander and bubblegum. 
A watery mouthfeel with a soft carbonation. Leaves a bitter, hoppy finish that lasts.…"
"Pours golden with a fizzy white head. Aroma is of malts, nuts, and mild spice. Taste is malty, with notes of spice, bubblegum, and weak hops. Better than anticipated, but still subpar."
"Nice clear golden color with two fingers of frothy white head that settles quickly leaving spotty loops of lacing.  Nice musty aroma, pale malts, spicy hops, creamy malt tastes not hint of skunking, mild hop spicing in the finish."
Pale yellow lager with frothy head and predominantly hoppy aroma. Hoppy and grainy with crisp citric notes and bitter finish. Very good European lager.
Good Czech Pils. Nothing extraordinary just a sessionable pale pilsner. Easy drinking and highly addictive it is a good beer for any occassion.
"Bottle.  Pours pale golden, with a big fluffy three-finger beige head, good lacing.  Smells of sweet, fruity malt and apples and fresh hay.  Thin, crisp, refreshing body.  Well balanced mild flavor, with a nice bitter aftertaste.  I really enjoy the subtle flavor of Saaz hops.  Very drinkable."
"Just a great brew.  The original pilsner to be respected to this day.  Crystal clear golden color some orange.  Nose of a wonderful bouquet.  Hops as well as a jumpy malt background.  Nice light bitter palate with a great alc. background.  The hops linger throughout the finish.   I remember watching the episode of """"""""The Beer Hunter where Michael went to the SABMiller brewery.  They have a great respect for the traditional Pilsner recipe."
"Poured from can. Great aroma, Nice color, Full flavor, normal bitter aftertaste (maybe a bit too much for my liking)."
"Bottle from the stonking phil_L beermerchants.com lottery. Good skills boys. Nice pils really. Typical appearance, fairly typical flavour but certainly better than the pils I’ve had recently. Proper bitter pils finish. Nice."
A nice smooth easy drinking beer with a light caramel color and scent.  The beer has a nutty aftertaste.  This is one of those beers you can drink all night long!
"Nice malty aroma, golden color.  Great malty hop balance.  Medium bodied, dry bitter aftertaste."
"Malty aroma, not sweet, slightly astringent.  Dark golden color.  A little dry, slightly sweet malty taste.  Finishes pleasantly bitter.  No floral hop flavor, unfortunately."
Bottle. Pours a golden color with small white head that stayed for awhile. had a very hoppy aroma. the taste was a sweet malt with a grainy finish. Easy to drink for a good session beer. A decent pilsener from Urquell.
"yellow body with a white head.light and peppery,nice on a hot day.or a great session brew."
"Date: 12/21/1995

Mode: Draft

Source: Taco Mac, Sandy Springs…"
Tasted over in Prague on a visit. Nice headd and slightly hazy. Enjoyable for this style. Some sweetness in there and dry to finish.
"On draugt. A clear golden colored beer, with a nice thick white head. The aroma is malty, a nice touch of hops, with some flowers. The taste is smooth bitter, hoppy and touches of fruits. It has a long soft bitter aftertaste."
Poured a light gold with a decently frothy head which was about 2 fingertips in width. A hoppy aroma with a very refreshing taste. Nicely balanced. Good beer.
"Golden color with a tint of orange to it, white head.  Weak aroma but picking up some malts.  Subtle malt flavor with spices.  Bit of a bitter aftertaste with a peppery twist to it.  Not bad as it warms up either."
"Bottle.  Pours a clear gold with bid 4 finger snow white head that receded fairly quickly and resulted in very spotty lacing.  Nose is malt, sweet corn and grassy hops. Taste is sweet malt, honey and grain with a decent pils bitter finish.  Medium, creamy mouth feel.  I’ve had this on tap before and it’s much better.  Still decent in bottles."
Bottle.Clear light golden color with a foamy white head.Crisp aroma of light floral hops. Tastes slightly sweet and refreshing. Aftertaste is slightly bitter and slightly metallic . A solid offering.
The beer I use to rate other beers against. This is how the beer should be - the ultimate!
"(bottle): Pours a golden honey color, big frothy snow white head. Grainy smell, malts. Malty, slightly toasted taste, grains, maybe hay. Somewhat fizzy. Eh, not my style."
"I finally got a fresh bottle and had to re-rate this beer.  Man what a difference.  A fresh bottle is truely a perfect example of what a pilsner should be.  Refreshing, crisp, and a good bite without a bad or strong aftertaste."
"Pretty pour, thick mouthfeel for a pils, bold and malty, sweetish flowery hops, better than average."
"One of my Favorite Lagers. Nice head, Soft but not too much. You can taste and smell the malt, and there is a great balance between bitterness and floral hops with a tiny sweet touch. Definetly a beer for a hot day, but one that you can really enjoy."
"Draft, Bottle , Can Czech and Slovak Republics.   This was the one that helped the world turn for me in 1992 when I lived there.  I purposly had not rated it since I knew I was returning for this years Beer trip.  It was certainly worth the wait for me.  A beautiful gold with hops and wet straw in the nose. Saaz all around.  Sweet upront ans a bit of earth in the body.  A mellow rounded finish makes you say Prosim ! Pet Piva!  (that’s please....five more beers) well worty the trip even though I can get a slightly lesser product at the local. It is my sturdy belief that this beer is of the perfect alcoho…"
I don’t thnk I’ve ever seen this out of a bottle.  Pours a small head that dissipates quickly.  Very clean and crisp orange-amber-gold body.  You can really smell the plant matter.  Taste is light until it hits the back of the tongue and you get a little jolt of bitter before it quickly goes down the gullet.  Very light and smooth mouthfeel.  Fun to drink.  Great pilsener!
"Pours a clear, pale gold with a very tall foamy white head. Stale aroma of pale malts and a little citrus. Taste is fairly clean, small sweet bump at first, then a somewhat bland grainy taste. Easy to drink, not much on the end except a little of that stale bread taste in the finish."
"If you don’t like this, you don’t like beer, period. Sure it’s not a Belgian abbey ale, but it isn’t meant to be. It’s the original, and still one of the best Pilsners. Intensely herby, slightly bitter grassy taste, moderate carbonation, clean mouthfeel, just excellence all over."
"Floral, banana, fruity smell.  Clean and crisp flavor with moderate hop bitterness.  Finish is clean and bitter."
"Grainy slightly skunky smell that alot of pilsners have.  Clear golden colour.  Foamy head doesn’t last long.  Tart grassy,  hoppy taste.  Bitter finish.  True to the pilsner style.  Not bad."
Clear gold pour. Fizzy white head and rather thin in the lace department.  Clean refreshing.  Thin bodied notable hints of hops
Bottle. Pours a very clear golden yellow. Not much head. The aroma is not too distinct.  Clean slightly hoppy taste. I am not a fan of pilsners in general. Not terrible. Went OK with some pizza.
"Absolutely one of the most unique beers I’ve ever tasted... very hoppy, beautiful golden color, perfectly skunky... good stuff! Cheers!"
Draught.  Yellow straw pour with a fizzy white head.  Aroma of pepper and malt.  Great balanced body with a nice bitter peppery finish.  Fantastic pils.
"Bottle at Captain Anderson’s Restaurant P.C. Beach, Fl.  Golden, straw colored with small white head. I think I know what ""grassy"" smells like now. Bitter with an aftertaste. Not impressed, but it was my first Pilsner."
"Very drinkable. Light in flavour yet leaves a nice impression. Yeasty, slightly lemony, grassy and malty. The kind of beer you can drink at any time of day or night."
"Bottle: (3,8%at the label) Clear yellow colour, with a thin head. Aroma of malts,grassy,and a nice bitter nose in the end. Flavor is mild,smouth thin mouth feeling,short finish."
"[on tap at brewery restaurant, Plzen]
Bright gold with a loasting, white blanket that formed good lacing.  Fresh malt and huge, fresh saaz aroma--freshest hops to have ever been smelled by this nose.  Sweet malt flavour balanced perfectly by noblle hops and ending with an ascertive bitterness that lasts for a little bit.  Light to medium body with plenty of carbonation.  The bitternes hangs on a little longer than I would have liked.…"
"I’ve had this in the can in the US and on draft in Plzen. There is a big difference. The canned version in the US is much better than bottles, but it still pales in comparision to draft in the Czech Republic. Grassy hops and a balanced matliness. Dry finish."
"In a nutshell, if it wasn’t for those wonderful Czechs and their love for beer, what we know and love about a large majority of our beers, the other side of ales, might not even exist. Truly, if it wasn’t for Pilsner Urquell, our modern beer world would be quite different.…"
"50cl Bottle @ home. Clear golden, white head. Aroma of grass and malts, hops. Flavour is dry, a bit sweet and grassy, bitter finish. Just a very good crisp pilsener."
"I do love this beer. The hype and rep lead many to expect too much from it, but as the model pilsner, I think it holds up well. Great looking in the glass, golden with a white fluffy head, spicy nose, and strong malty flavour with the perfect followup of aggressive hops leaving a long dry finish. Makes me happy that it’s easy to obtain this world classic here in Hamilton, NZ."
"16oz can. pours clear golden with small white head. nose is sweet bread, corn. flavors are sweet biscuit, adjuncty, spicy and leathery hops. fizzy carbonation. pretty refreshing though.3.0.…"
"Pours straw-color with small head.  Aroma citrusy, spicy, herbal, and yeasty, very enjoyable.  Flavor is very herbal and yeasty up front with some sweeter citrus notes in the back.  Nothing too special here, but I think pilseners get a bad rap in general, so it might be worth a try for a solid pilsener."
"Bottle. Pours a straw yellow with white very short-lasting head. Aroma is citrus, but in a very sour way. Mouthfell is just wrong, and the taste is, well, morning urine. Nope, didn’t like this pilsner either."
"Draft. Pours a golden yellow color with the perfect sized head. Smell is a little funky, but not very strong. Taste is crisp, well balanced, yet weak. Somewhat of a skunk flavor as well, but not too bad."
"Bottle. A light sour and quite hoppy smell, also a light smell of soap and grass. A large white creamy head and a golden body. The taste is moderate bitter with a average duration. The body is light to medium, very dry and light creamy with a soft carbonation and a light metallic and quite astringent finish. A good Pilsener."
"Draft. Lighty straw color with a big soapy, foamy, white head. Weak aroma, though not bad with some bitterness and hay. Light flavor, some sourness with a nice hop kick balancing things out in the finish. A sharp, refreshing mouthfeel. Not an amazing beer, but solid for the style and one of the better mass produced pils you’ll find at a lot of bars."
"First real notes on this one, and from a bottle. Gold with a nice white head. Light and crisp like every Urquell I’ve ever had. Slightly bitter hops balance out the bready malts. Classic all the way. I remember the tap being better, though at the time I was also sitting outside in 70F after moving for two hours. Still, a delightful beer for the warm months no matter how it’s served. This would be wonderful at a baseball game."
"From a 12 fl. oz. green bottle marked 05268-01:17.  Pours a golden yellow with an abundent supply of foamy white head and adequate lacing.  The head sticks around for the session.  Decent sweet malts and yeast in the aroma. Medium mouth feel. Flavor is strong on malts with a light, hoppy finish.  An enjoyable experience."
"Dreaft, pours golden with a thin white head.  The aroma was wheat, yeast, and a little bit of hops.  The taste was very watered down and strong with wheat.  It was rather refreshing and smooth going down, but nothing real special here."
"500ml bottle. White medium thick head. Golden-orange color. Sweet peachy aroma. Flavor is some what bitter, well balanced, clean with little bit hops. Very good in it’s own league."
"Ah, a nice malty aroma, a beautiful golden pour with a puffy white head. Taste? To me, it very much tasted like piss. Sorry, since this seems to be a high rated beer, everything was pleasant but the taste."
"Bottle. Pours clear and golden. Slight hop aroma. Taste is bitter, clear, refreshing. Fine beer, especially for SAB we’ll crush all in our path Miller."
"Slight bitterness, crisp and clean after taste.  Light blond color with a typical pilsner head."
"12 oz. bottle.  A beautiful dark yellow/golden colour, with a white head that quickly disappeared.  No lacing.  Aroma was grass, yeast with a hint of pine.  Taste was crisp and clean, slightly bitter with a hops finish.  A great pilsener, especially compared to it’s watered down macro grandchildren."
"Pours golden with perfect clarity and a thin white film. Aroma is flowery and spicy. Good saaz aroma and flavor, however it’s balanced by a smooth, slightly sweet malt character, reminiscent of sweet potato. Dry/peppery finish. Definitely one of the better mass-produced offerings."
Golden color with white head which disappears very quickly.  Aroma of hops and skunk.  Light flavor and body with a minimal hop and bread finish.
"gold no head, wheaty with some dark tastes to it above the lesser pilsners."
on tap - Yellow golden beer with big white head. Slight hops aroma. Nice hops aroma with a slight bitterness.
"A really good pilsner lager.  light, but not ""watered down"" like most american macros.  Slightly sweet, slightly malty, slightly hopped, slightly dry....  more hops than budvar and really smooth."
Bottle.  Darker gold/yellow than most of the genre with a white head that vanishes almost immediately.  Decent malty aroma with hoppy overtones.  Initially slightly cloying sweetness resolves to an excellent dry bitterness.  Full bodied on the palate.  A good all-rounder but not the flawless gem it’s purported to be.  There are much better Czech pilsners out there.
The gold standard of Pilsners.  Nice yellow color with a small white head.  Crisp clean taste with an aroma of malt and floral hops.  Draft is better than the bottle.  I noticed that the brewery has attempted to reduce the skunkiness by covering the six packs with a cover.  Switching to brown bottles would eliminate the problem entirely.
"It’s just too hard to get a fresh pilsner urquell these days.  I know it’s good from times I’ve had a good one, but it’s been a long time.  The last few I’ve had have a nice dry hoppy finish, but a skunky character overall.  Not that enjoyable."
"Canned version from LCBO.  No skunk in this one, just a hoppy aroma to go with a golden pour  topped by an off white head.  An average maltly start with a nice hoppy finish, lingering biiter finish.  An great Euro pils."
"Bottle 22 oz. Clear golden w precious few large bubbles rising. White head fell quickly to a thin film. Aroma is pale malt w Euro hops and a touch of grass & citrus. Flavor is immediately tart & tangy, dry malt and moderately bitter Euro tasting hops. Nice malt flavor and hop bitterness on the finish. Pushing medium bodied. A bit astringent & alcaline. Nice change from the big, sweet, hoppy American ales. 2/23/06 I’m upping this .2. I got a very good 22 ozer of this today. Very clean, and not the least bit harsh or stale tasting like it can sometimes be. Very refreshing, I wanted more big time. I…"
"Draught, Hotel Mercure Korona, Budapest. This seemed to be the best on offer at the time and expectations were low going by what I’d tried at home in a bottle. It was Ok though and I guess this is a pretty good exponent of the genre. Crisp and clean tasting with some maltiness. Not a bad get out of jail card."
"Good but I have to say its way over rated on here.  Carbonated and decently hoppy, I think its way better than the avg European light colored stuff.  I would like the American stuff to go more in this direction, but its still only something I would grab if its the best available."
Pours a clear golden color with a small bubbly white head that lingered throughout with a little lacing. Mild grainy malt aroma with a hint of skunk.  The taste is slightly better with a decent balance of bitterness and malts.  Mouthfeel is light but not watery - very crisp and clean on the palate.  This is better than most Euro pilsners and is fairly drinkable.
"draught 330ml 3,2€ at OpusK Lohja served on brand  own glass & beermat
color:pale yellow
Taste: sweet malts ,bit butter ,huge carbonation hops. I don’t remember when I tasted Urquell before this maybe once at beersociety blind test. Surely it tasted better  my trip to  Plzen  Jan 2000."
"330mL Bottle. FIrst time I had this it was my new favourite. The aroma was so fresh, and a strong bitterness to finish. Grabbed a dozen to rate the other day only to find the expiry was 2weeks out and slightly skunked, hence the lower ratings. Pale golden beer. Floral aroma, crisp beer with a clean malt taste follwed by the Czech hop bitterness its known for."
Draft. Color is golden yellow with a big white head. Aroma is a bit buttery. Flavor is buttery and sweet with a bitter finish of fresh hops.
"Draft at Capital Ale House Downtown.  Pours a light golden yellow with brilliant clarity and small white head with good lacing.  Aroma is very weak, a little cardboard and faint floral hops.  Hop flavor has an earthiness to it and a little buttery, but not in a bad way.  Soft mouthfeel and medium bodied, almost velvety.  Easy drinking.  Spot on for a pilsner."
"Golden color, kind of a bananaish smell. Tastes a bit hoppy with more flabby fruit in there. Good if you cant get any other microbrews, but otherwise, why?"
"My favourite draught pilsener, a great pour.  Good smell about it and a fabulous taste.  Yum."
"Not a fan of the style, but this is good for a mass produced beer. Very skunky. I’m looking forward to trying the real thing at the brewery in Plzen."
Pours deep amber into a footed pilsner. Fluffy white head leaves sheet lacing as it slowly recedes.  Skunk aromas.  Crisp and malty upfront with a lasting slightly skunked hop finish.
"Bottle: pours a clear, golden amber with a thin white head, aroma of grains, taste is grainy and a little bitterness from the hops, probably the best choice when all you have to select from are mass produced beers."
"On draft in Prague. Medium white head and clear darkish yellow color. Nose is a bit hoppier than usual, as well as flowery.  Clean crisp sweet malt at first and also a nice mild bitter finish. Certainly one (if not the best) of the best pilsners i had in Czech."
"On tap @ The Perfect Pint, NYC. Pours a pale golden yellow. Dry mildly bitter grassy aroma.Taste is dry, sharp, mild bitterness & crisp. Easy drinking"
On tap: pilsner-esque aroma.  Taste is similar with heavy carbonation and a slight bitterness.  Nice beer.
"Bottle. Clear pale amber with no head. Pleasant hoppy aroma. Light body, well carbonated. Lovely flavour starting with sweet malt shifting rapidly to a long pleasantaly hoppy bitter finish. An excellent pilsner."
"Pours clear golden with a white head. Woody and earthy hop aroma. Flavor is more of the same. Not too complex, but smooth and clean. Decent."
"Pours nice bright gold, large but short lived head. This is a very attractive beer in the glass- picture perfect.  There is an undeniable first aroma of Saaz hops- crisp, fresh, and spicy.  The bitter dryness on the first sip sets you up for a bracing and appetizingly dry, complex pilsner, unforgettanbly original.... THE original.  The palate is soft and crisp, and there is a pleasant effervesence in the mouthfeel.  Very light bready malt, full-on, noble Saaz hops.  For a crisp, full-bodied, straight-forward and dry pilsner, there is no better choice."
"Nice golden color that produces a foamish white head. Good consistent carbonation.This is not a complex beer but does have some stronger aromas from the European hops. This beer has an overtone of hops and finishes very clean. This is a beer best enjoyed when cold and while a mass produced beer it does have a bit of traditional Pilsener lines behind the recipe. 
It is a fun beer to enjoy when the pickings are slim a the grocery store."
"12 oz. bottle into pint glass and on tap at a restaurant the same night.  Not too light golden or overly carbonated like American macro pilsners; has a descent lasting white head.  Refreshing with a nice hop character. Refreshing, and one of the better pilsners out there."
"Very nice.  Aroma is full of well balanced hops.  It’s body is a golden color, with a huge head.  It’s flavor is a well-balanced bitterness - minor malt body.  It’s palate is easy, finishes with a nice tartness."
"Pours golden yellow with slight white head. Sweet malty aroma with saaz hops protruding. The mouthfeel is surprisingly full with a forceful initial sweetness ending in the usual hoppy finish.

"Light gold color with small white head and little lacing. Funky roasted aroma, but flavor is much better. Rich malt and light hops with a bready aftertaste. This was much better the second time I tried it. Good overall"
"Bottle from Whole Foods Market Charlottesville. Orange pour with a quickly disappearing head. Grassy, malty aroma with a lot of skunk. Taste is grassy, bready with a nice hop bite."
"50 cL can. Pours clear and golden yellow to orange with a lacing white head. Mild fruity hops aroma, light accents of peach. Flavour is light sweet and fruity. Very mild bitterness into the finish. Nice balance and delicate hops bitterness and fruityness.6-4-7-3-13=3.3…"
"330ml bottle from Unwins. Pale gold with white bubbly head. Along with Budvar, one of my favourites. Nice pilsner citric hop. OK in mouth with satisfying hop citric finish. More flavour than most lagers too..  2.7.5.0  Re-rate Draught at blind tasting at Modry Abbe.  Pretty looking beer, clear gold, thick cream head.  Excellent carbonation.  NO huge aroma, some hop on finish.  No bad or off flavours, nothing to make it unattractive.  It’s fine.  Even some drinkability."
"(Can). Pours a deep golden with a small white head. A lot of malt in the aroma, some grain and bread notes, caramel, and flowery too. Flavor is bitter with some little sweet notes and very malty. Despite the low alc.%, it has a medium body, it’s not soft nor watery, and it’s pretty well balanced. Clean and bitter finish, and sooo refreshing."
"i wanted to like it more, but i blame it on the green bottle.  smells skunky, but not horrible.  i like the clean hops and malt in this one, very crisp and refreshing.  bready, sort of cereal malts.  moderately bitter.  goes really well with food.  i wish they’d use brown bottles instead. great warm weather beer though, and i hear it’s going to be 110 tomorrow."
"Bottle.  Pours a really nice golden color with a decent pillowy white head that fades slightly, but lasts for a good while.  Has a very nice malt/hop balance and taste.  Kind of sweet and is fairly bitter.  The aroma matches the taste.  Overall, this is a fairly refreshing and fulfilling beer, that is well worth the price and I would not mind buying this again."
"Let me start by saying, i’m an anti pilsner kind of person, I have never met a pilsner that I liked. But if one ever came close, this is it. Nice golden colour, no head, and spotty lacing. Flowery aroma. 
There is some sweetness in the flavor, but it is subtle, and is overpowerd by the hoppy bitterness. A very dry finish. Good carbonation and mouthfeel. Still, not my cup of tea."
"Bottle from Tank’s Bar & Grill in Dayton.  Has a typical pilsener, lager aroma.  Clear bright golden in color with a white head.  Has a decent bitter sweet taste.  It’s pretty much what I expected from a quality pilsener, nothing too surprising.  Definitely a clean, crisp finish though."
"500 mL can:  Can’t say I’l rave about this one, as some domestic pilsners are much more fresh.  Everything is typical for the style, but little too sour and bitter for my liking, especially the finish.  Perhaps it is the can, as I can see where this would be going if on tap.  I’ll go for a Steamwhistle  or JR Brickman Pilsner or even a Grasshopper if I want this type of beer. Have had this before where there has been a little more sweetness coming through.  Maybe this was a bad  can.  A solid pils."
"nice pilsener aroma, quite strong aroma for a macro. white head, relatively large, darkish clear yellow. Looks great. bitter taste (like pilsene) but a little more sweetness and bitterness than the average pilsener. aftertaste is sweet combined with pilsener. aftertaste lasts for a while. Great taste for a ""low"" alc.% beer."
Considering this is a mass produced beer it doesn’t seem to suffer the problems of other such beers in that you pretty much know what you are going to get all the time.
12oz bottle: pours golden brown with large white head that fades to lacing in about a minute. aroma of very pale grain and some hints of butterscotch. best lager i have ever had could apeal to anyone looking for an easy drinker all the way up to the biggest beer snob.
"Bottle, draught etc, amongst other @ Plzensky Prazdroj brewery in Plzen. Large frothy white lasting head. Always a good display of lacework. Aroma is clear Czech Saaz with the classic dusty earthy floral notes. Mild spicy appearance can also be picked up. Hint of malt can be picked up as well. Over the palate came lovely and well balanced hoppy and malty mix. Medium bodied with an average carbonation and mild dry and smooth crispy texture. Moderated bitter and sweet flavor in a well balanced way. Finish off is crisp smooth dusty floral bitterness with an average duration. This really is the…"
"The thing I most remember about this beer is that it had one of the most memorable aromas that jumped out at me as soon as I opened the bottle.  It was crisp and fairly strong, but not overpowering.  The appearance wasn’t all too impressive to me -- yellow with a head that dissipated within a minute or two.  Flavor was good for a light beer as this, especially since I am a fan of the darker beers.  There was enough of a hoppy taste to tell you are drinking a good beer, but not so much hops as to overpower the taste.  Overall a well-balanced taste.  The texture was a bit thin but smooth.…"
"500ml bottle.[br]
Slightly creamy crisp lager aroma - not particularly hoppy. Refreshing subtle hoppy taste, again a bit creamy. The hop bitterness is quite short, but it is most pleasant while it’s there. Perhaps a little thin, but that makes it quite a drinkable pilsner. This is the beer all other pilsners should be compared to - if it’s worse than this it really isn’t very good."
"Unpastuerized (but still filtered) from tap at U Zlatého Tygra in Prague


Aroma:  malty, wheaty, bready, biscuits…"
"RERATE 9/07: Floral nose, slightly citric, golden body, white head dissipates rapidly. Floral and citric/fruity notes in the flavor a bit grainy but not badly so refreshing. Moderate bitterness."
"Sampled this in the French Quarter.  Just happy to find something other than shit-ass.  
Paid 11 for the pint (geez).  But a historic beer for a historic place.  as it warmed it tasted like sam adams lager.... ehh whatever wont buy this again, but wasnt terrible."
"Appearance: Dark yellow, little head.
Aroma: Honey, hopsy.
Taste: Smooth, not very exciting.
Info: 660ml bottle, 5/10-2005, 34/300, 19/500"
"Nice Czech beer One of the best from the Czech, or at least one of the best that is exported to Sweden. Very crispy body, with some nice bitterness and very light tones of butterscotch. Perfect for a warm summer day"
It truly is the greatest pilsner. If I were only a fan this would be bliss. No one can argue the purity and design of this ageless beer.
"this is a damn good pilsener, great smooth balanced flavor and very drinkable!"
This is a good beer if you’re in a place that does not generally serve micros or Belgians.  It is one of the only solid Pilsners for the style.  It pours a golden color and is even in the flavor with a nice hop bit at the end.
"On tap at Yeoman’s Road Pub (Tampa, FL) on 6/21/08. Pours a clear, golden color with thin, white head. Aroma: slight wheat, grape and fresh grass notes. Flavor: sweet honey, malt, hops. Light-bodied beer with a bitter finish."
"You know I was in a restuarant in NYC sometime ago for lunch and they mentioned to me the beer list.  Not much: standard macros,but they had Urquell! Ahhh!  I always know that if you are ever in pinch - Pilsner Urquell never fails.  A solid classic pilsner."
"what a beer...crisp and golden with a fluffy white head, it has a honey and citrus aroma and the taste is a  buttery, pleasantly bitter mix of floral hops and light maltiness. originally had this in a beer cellar in Prague. 50 cent pints. It was magical..."
"Found this at a local grocery store in a pint can.  Color is golden yellow with a little head when poured with medium carbonation.  Aroma has a floral hoppiness to it along with a less distinctive sweet malt aroma.  Flavor is very Saazy floral with sweet malt flavor and no aftertaste.  I have had this from the bottle and tasted the skunkiness but from the can, this is completely absent and really allows you to taste what the beer should taste like."
33cl bottle at home: Bright med-dark gold with a very white frothy head. Sweet pale malt nose with honey. Noble hops supply some earthy spice. Very light toast.  Flavor is a good blend of sweet malt  and smooth hop. It definitely leans more to the sweet malt side than the hop side. Effervescent hop bite in middle but back to malt for the finish. Some toast pops up in the middle. Crisp with a bit of a minerally quality.
"Had this at a beer tasting event. Hoppy aroma covered in skunk. Nice golden appearance. Flavor wasn’t nearly as skunky as the aroma was. It was quite hoppy, well balanced. Nice to taste a true pilsener rather than the weak American light beer type pilsener. Still, I’m not a huge fan of this type of beer. Too light, still too watery, and a skunky profile thanks to the green bottle. The flavor is the best part, which is what matters, but overall the beer isn’t anything special in my eyes."
"Standard pilsener appearance - yellow/gold with a decent looking white head. The aroma is mostly of grassy hops with a nice, but restrained malt sweetness. The flavor is nicely hoppy, grassy, herbal and a hint of floral presence as well. This balances really nicely the malt characteristics of the beer to create a solid bittersweet flavor. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth, yet just crisp enough to be refreshing. This is an eminently drinkable beer."
"Tall boy can at U.S. Cellular Field poured into a tall plastic cup. Sizeable head that dissipates fairly quickly and a body that looks like a nice somber honey color. Nice looking. Initial aromas are a little grassy, some nice noble hops sweetness, and a little bit of pilsener malt stink. Taste is assertive. A nice bitter sweetness balanced by nice pilsener malt. A very nice beer and a good find at a ball game."
"Bottled at home. I’ve been enjoying this beer since 1982.  In the mid 80s I followed Michael Jackson’s recommendation and tried it at  U Zlatého Tygra in Prague. I’ve never tasted a pils as fine since. All things considered, its still a pretty good beer. Fresh, malty and bready with bags of zatec hoppiness. I can’t wait to go back to its homeland to try the unpasturised and unfiltered versions."
"Fredagsbaren på Biologi, Aarhus, DK.
Bottled.
Clear golden with nice white head. Aroma of bread malt and some grassy notes. Nice mouthfeeling. Solid bitterness. Well balanced"
"5Ocl can, golden with small white head. Smell is hoppy with a hint of hay. Nicely carbonated and hoppy flavor with rich aftertaste, overall a good pilsener."
"Poured golden yellow with a generous bright white head into a pilsner glass. Bubbles rising to the top like champagne. Clean hoppy aroma with some citrus - distinctively pilsner. Taste was less intense than the aroma, but included some biscuits and malts. Very soft mouthfeel, nice carbonation, and a very crisp finish."
"Aroma is largley malty with a grassy hop character as well. The beer looks pretty enough in a glass, it is a deep golden color with a big fluffy white head. Flavor is of straw, earth, salt, and bitter hops. This beer is very clean and refreshing."
"Nice amber color. Excellent ballance, not too carbonated, moderately bitter via the awesome Saaz hops. Very lively beer! The best pilsner in my opinion. I can’t imagine it any better than it already is.…"
"A relatively pale beer leads to an unexpectedly strong flavor when drank. In any event however, this is a mediocre beer in a beautiful package that is better than expected, yet in no way memorable."
Good everyday beer or good with chicken or fish.  Light in color and flavor.  Goes down with ease.
"clear gold. no legs. bright nose. corn, brass, sugar, sour, bitter. its a clean pilsner. soft mouth. fair enough."
"Like this beer for the bitter, yet refreshing mouth ride.  Best served cold.  Goes well with most food and is a quality favorite."
"Bottle @ home
The first great beer I ever tried and the milestone to which I compare other beers. It pours a refreshing golden colour, has a thin-to-moderate head to it and has a long lasting, delicious bitter taste. Truly the king of the pilsener style."
Grainy malts and grassy hops in aroma. Flavor is mostly the same. Average bitterness.
"12oz bottle.  Dark yellow pour, not quite golden,  very clear.  thick, bitter taste, with an especially bitter finish.  A stark contrast to standard American pilseners."
Nice refreshing pilsener.  Hoppy flavour and a good bitter finish.   A good beer for warm nights.
Bottle @ The BeerBistro Toronto: Deep golden.  Big floral honeyed aroma with obvious saaz character.  Malty flavour with only the slightest trace of corn.  Oily palate with a medium body.  Nice long bitter finish.  Surely a classic.
"Fast disappearing head on a golden body. This beer gives the impression of being ""clean"". Fresh, thirst-quenching, it’s the perfect drink for a summer evening. I’d drink it again any time."
Pours a decent head but doesn’t retain it at all.  Horse blanket aroma with notes of corn and pale malt.  Bitter and slightly metallic finish.  Perhaps mine wasn’t the freshest.  I’d like to try it on tap.
"Bottle pours a crystal gold color with a short lived head, no lace.  The aroma is saaz and some barley.  The flavor is malt and hops playing together in the glass.  The palate is brothy and lively.  It is what it is - a good Pilsener.  Not much else."
Nice golden color- not very appealing aroma- strong bitterness- a touch metallic
"Bottle, pours a lovely golden color with minimal lacing.  Honestly doesn’t smell very good, notes of grains, hops and corn.  There is an initial almost sweet, creamy malt and hop flavor, a definite grain presence, and perhaps some corn.   However the beer finishes with an astringent bitter, metallic-hop flavor which I am not too fond of.  One of the better pilsners out there, but the horrid aftertaste kills it for me.  I’d rather have an ale."
"Deep golden in color with a nice bubbly white froth.  Smells is of bitter euro hop and some sweet malt.  Flavor is a delicate balance of sweet and bitter, with a slightly salty finish.  Really tasty stuff that’s both extremely satisfying and thoroughly well crafted.  Hard to top in terms of pils."
Bottle: Strong skunk smell. Light easy to drink pilsner. Has a skunky aftertaste. Wasn’t impressed overall.
pours a golden yellow color. taste is very clean and refreshing. definitely couldn’t be copied or immitated very well.
"Pours dark golden with hardly any head.  Malty nose with the same taste with a good, hoppy crispness in the finish.  Not incredible, but drinkable and tasty."
Pours a clear golden brown colour with a medium head. Notcieably skunky aroma with a hint of fruit. Taste is pretty grainy all the way throughout this beer.
"Gold body with a quickly shrinking head. Can’t break the smell apart...yet. Thick palate for an abv of 4.4 on a see -through beer. Oily. A nice hoptitude. The taste lingers and lingers and ...lingers..until you put something else in your mouth. My version was Czech and in the evil green bottle covered by cardboard variety. $7.99 a sixer in South Carolina, worth the price for an original, maybe not so for an American of the same ilk."
"This is simply an outstanding pilsner.    It is a beautiful deep golden, with a large, thick white head that slowly dissipates to a small head  The aroma is bready, malty grain with hints of nuts and grassy hops.  The taste is lightly grassy but mostly grain, a hint of bread, faintly toasty malt, with a crisp hoppy grassy character with light citrus element, bite & bitterness, esp. in the finish.  The  palate is very full and even a bit thick.  It is well balanced and very drinkable, yet tasty.  The hoppiness is pronounced and lingers, but is not overly bitter and marries well with the strong toasted grain…"
"Pours a beautiful sparkling deep gold with excellent head, and good lace retention.  Sweet malty aromas with complex notes of aeromatic hops- suggestions of dusty citrus, anise, and medicinal phenols.  Medium bodied with satisfying mouthfeel and effervecence.  Sweet malty taste initially, but quickly gives was to a crisp, clean hop bitterness that is very appetizing.  Finish is somewhat dry with suggestions of pine, herbs, wet hay, and citrus rind.  An important beer for any beer reviewer to be aquainted with; knowing this beer gives interesting insights into how the ""pilsner""-…"
"Ugh...I expected quite a bit more out of the ’model of meter’ pilsners.

I’ll never be happy with this beer as I find Pils to be the most boring type of beer made and it frustrates me that it’s the world’s most popular.…"
"I was very impressed.  For something that comes in a green bottle, the taste was not skunky at all.  White head, light body and a little sting on the back end.  I could see myself ordering this in the future."
"Bottle. Pours gold with a white head. Malty aroma with a hint of almost herbal hops. Light, body, very crisp and refreshing. Clean malt flavor with a hop presence that shows itself in a rather short finish. Very good considering it’s wide availability."
"Bottle.  Solid pilsener that seems much improved since they changed the packaging to shield it from light.  Clean grain flavor with a light, slighty soapy hop finish."
"12-ounce green bottle. Pours a clear gold color with little head but constant bubbles. Immediate hoppy aroma, medium body, soft mouthfeel, mellow, but distinctive hops flavor, slight sulfur character - OKAY though. Nice malty presence matched to the hops. Hops bitterness lingers slightly into the finish. Very nice."
"At first this doesn’t seem to be very complex, but there truly is hiding something personal under the bitterness. I could find a creamy and fruity aroma when it wasn’t too cold anymore."
"Pours a bright gold with a big fizzy head. A bit too carbonated even for the style. Some hop bitterness but thats it. I’ve heard this was much better about twenty years ago.

"(Bottled). Color is clear, golden yellow. Medium white head is lacy and a bit flowery. Sweet malty aroma is smoothly buttery and grassy hoppy. Flavor is buttery, grassy hoppyness balances beer nicely. Aftertaste is quite long. Medium-bodied and a smoothly carbonated oily palate."

"golden clear appearance with solid head.  flavor varies amongst some bottles and pints i have had, but at best has a nice munich pilsner malt flavor with a crisp hop finish.  it can be one of the best pilseners around when the flavor is on"
"First of all, I do not underrate pilseners as a style. I really like a well made pilsener, and this one is the standard. Deep orange gold color, with beautiful white head that lasts for some time. Malty aroma with noticeable hops. The taste begins sweet and then gets bitter with the aroma hops dominating the dry finish. A wonderful bier!"

Pours a brilliant, bright,  honey-orange color; significant white head with excellent retention and lacing; the head leaves small aggregrations of foam on the top of the beer; a beautiful pour.  Pleasant aroma, showing toasted grains, sugar, and just a touch of mineral and citrus hops; nice dryness, if a little basic in the malt character (a touch of cardboard); excellent otherwise.  Medium mouthfeel: crisp and dry on the tip of the tongue; some breadiness and dough, and even a touch of estery malts at the core; more developed than the…"
Typical Euro skunkiness.  I once read where this beer was considered one of the world’s best.  I think other beers have come a long way since that time.
"very refreshing bitter, classy pilsner with lots of hops and well carbonated clear greenish yellow colour and white head (label effecting my image?)"
"Bottle: I have always really liked this beer, although I have not had one in a while.  Aroma and flavor is a little skunky, but in a good way.  Very drinkable."
"Bottle. Pours a clear golden color, very small white head. Aroma is malt, maybe a touch of hops in there. Flavor is again malt and in the background some hops. A little bitter, but a decent beer overall."
"From the bottle: Aroma of grain, moderate hops, grass, light cheese, mustard and rollerskate. Sounds uninviting but it was a wonderfully refreshing character for me to experience. Clear pale yellow with an average one finger white frothy head that fully diminished, rather quickly too. Flavor and finish both a little acetic and somwhat sweet; the body oily but lively carbonated. Left chalk in the gutters. It may be that this one was skunked or it may be the character of the beer; either way I can’t knock it and I definitely haven’t had my last."
"The original Pilsner, although not what it used to be from what I gather.  This is a very solid beer, with the classic Saaz hops aroma and crisp, clean finish."
"Pours a deep yellow, with a thick head. Floral hop aroma. Flavor is malts with hops balancing it out nicely. They only drawback was there was a bit too much grain in the aftertaste. I’m not usually one for pilsners, but I would buy this one again."
"...one of the best pilsners out there, and the benchmark to compare others to.  Great malt flavors, and a slight hop finish.  Light in a way, but not lacking body.  Pretty good, but I don’t drink it that often."
"Color is straw yellow with a decent fizzy white head.  Taste is of malts, grains, some hops.  Smell is crisp, malty, and light.  Overall pretty decent."
"Golden, clear pour, medium bubbling, small white head that dissapears in a flash. This beer has an earthen, stone, sweet, hoppy aroma and flavor, and of course, is skunked by the time it gets to the United States. It’s the best golden lager no doubt, probably. I don’t know what (SouthAfricanBreweries)-Miller has undone to the beer.  The flavor is of a bland malt with a medium-strong hop flavor coming on halfway through and in the finish. It’s smooth and has a mild aftertaste and mild carbonation. The beer pours a little dark and with a velvety, dense white head from the bottle."
Bottled.  Nice Saaz aroma with malty undertones. Crisp and refreshing.  Very carbonated.  Pretty golden color.
im going to say honestly one of the most disgusting beers i have ever tasted in my entrie life!
"[i]Bottled.[/i] Beautiful deep golden. Hopped, grassy aroma with malts and light honey. Only slightly mineral. Malty and well hopped, hayish flavor. Pretty intense infact. Dry and nicely bitter finish. Medium bodied, strongly carbonated palate. A good, honest dry pils."

"(bottle) Opened without much hiss.  Already I can smell the signature Saazy aroma.  Seemed a little undercarbed, but after pouring no worries about the head - it’s there.  First taste beings a crisp, watery mouthfeel, which evolves into a melanoidin-laden finish.  This is one of the clearest Pilseners you will see, and although it is a little less bitter than I seem to remember it, it is so easy to drink that it’s dangerous.  No wonder this is a world famous beer."

"Quite possibly the best beer on the planet. I am certainly yet to drink better! Pale gold, moderate head, crisp, bitter taste. The original and best pilsener."
"12oz bottle. Pours hazy yellow with a fluffy white head, no lace. Smells like corn and grains. Tastes of corn and grain as well. Thin body, coats the mouth a bit, cispish carbonation."
"Golden and very clear beer with almost no head. Mild, pleasant aroma of hops and flowers. 

Soft sticky mouth feel, but pleasant. Flavor is strong bitter hops with clear undertones of malt and fruits. Very well done. Bottle"
"Beautiful, deep amber hued golden yellow, with a perfect sized white head, and a constant stream of bubbles flowing upwards.  The aroma is more malty than hoppy.  Interesting.  There is also a hint of skunk in the aroma.  The hops are very mild, the malt is bolder than expected.  The carbonation is not too heavy.   Best part of the flavor is the lack of the skunk from the aroma.  This is a pretty solid beer."
"500ml can. Pours a beautiful dark gold with tiny bubbles rising from the center. Smells of lagerish grain and noble hops. Taste is smooth and crisp, nice dry malt. The hops bitterness at the end was stronger than I expected and completely delicious. This beer is an excellent experience. Palate is medium to light. Can is definitely a good choice over a green bottle, not a bit of oxidation in this beer."
"I’ve had this beer a bunch of times from the bottle and now a few times on draft and it always seems quite a bit better on draft. I’ve had some bottles that were a little skunky so those have been hit or miss. I’m rating this based on my draft the other day (4/9/08). Golden colored with just a relatively thin head. Bready malty flavor with a touch of sweet fruits, a richer mouthfeel than expected and crisp, clean and refreshing.  A sour note surfaces as the beer warms a touch. I’ll certainly get it again but maybe not often via the bottle as I fear Mr. Skunk. Solid brew."
Pours a clear golden color with a medium fizzy white head.  Sweet malty bread aroma.  Nice balance of mild hops and malt on the tongue.  Very crisp and refreshing.  A great pilsner.
bottle. pours a golden color with a large fluffy white head. smells of bready malts. Tastes of fresh dough and vanilla ice cream. nice fuzzy mouthfeel. the original holds up fairly well.
"(cleaning out my beer bottle collection as pictured in my profile and utilizing ratebeer.com)
As I recall, nice Czech pilsner.  Flavors are bitter and almost sour.  Hoppy and smooth."
"12 oz bottle, pours golden with a quickly waning head, not much lacing- just a few spotty patches on the glass. Smell is sweet and bready, some saaz aroma is detectable but slight. Taste is mildly bitter, some supportive malt sweetness and medium body. Finish is abrupt. It is obvious that this is a mass produced product but it is head and shoulders above the domestic counterparts like Budweiser (who legally stole the name of another czech pils-) and Miller(whose conglomerate Urquell is owned by). It has declined a bit even in just the last 5 years, but I still consider this…"
"Large, white, fast fading head atop a pale gold body; no lacing.  Grassy aroma.  Sweet, honeyish flavor.  Light-to-medium bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel.  Clean, dry, mildly bitter, short lived finish."
"on tap a the auld dubliner 


smelled corny and mildy noble hoppy…"
Pours a blonde orangey colour with a bit of head. The aroma is sweet and earthy. Slight aftertaste. Tastes like corn.
"Tall slender 12oz. green bottle poured into a pilsner.
Pours a clear sun kissed yellow with moderate to heavy carbonation action and a thin white head that layers the beer.  On the nose, grains, malts, and a slight citrus hop.  Carbonation and a brief hop spice up front that is quickly overwhelmed by the malts in the back of the mouth. An extremely crisp beer that leaves a little hop bitterness behind in the aftertaste.  Refreshingly crisp beer that hits the spot. I can see why this…"
"I like to drink this one when I am working on my car.  It tastes better in a can for some reason.  I always thought cans make beer taste like metal, but this one has a weird skunky taste out of a bottle that is not present out of the can.  Good as a beer you can knock back a few of."
"The beer that gave us the name ""Pilsener"".  This is the standard of that type.  Lovely golden color, moderate to slight head that leaves thin but pretty lacing.  Nose is of bread/wheat.  Taste is a near perfect combination of sweet and bitter.  Finish is that hoppy finish that other beers try to emulate and miss the target."
"Nice grassy sweet aroma.
Pours copper-gold from the 500ml. can.
Nice white head with moderate lacing.
Flavor is slightly sweet at first then a fair amount of bitter on the back of the tongue.…"
"Spicy floral nose.  Orangey gold color, medium head.  Clean mild malty sweetness balanced by delicate spicy hops.  Solid carbonation, clean finish with a subtle floral note.  Really one of the best Pilsners available...always a solid choice."
"12 oz bottle pours a clear golden.  Aroma is of floral hops and bready malt.  Flavor is malty, hoppy and rather dry."
"light to medium light, very crisp with a small amount of initial bitterness, initial aftertaste is not good, half way through bottle the aftertaste is non existent and beer gets substantially better"
"Orange-yellow with a good head. Strong hoppy aroma of saaz on a caramel base. Nice dry, hoppy flavour of grass and straw and some biscuits to go along. I don’t know if it is diminshed over the years (even though I tried a couple of gulps at the brewery in 1987 as a 9 year old non-connaiseur), but nevertheless I find it very potent!"
A very good beer.  A clear yellow in colour with a white head that quickly diminishes.  It has a hoppy and bitter taste and a clean finish.  Now I have to go to my Biology class.  Good thing this wasn’t a barly wine.  I drank this out of a lager glass.
"Pours a crisp golden color with a thin white head that fades quickly.  Aroma is skunky, grass, and slightly hoppy.  Taste is malty, corn, with a bit of citrus.  A decent pilsner but doesn’t excite me too much."
"grass, hay, floral, golden, clear, frothy head, lingering head,  medium sweetness, medium bitterness, light body, medium texture, nice mellow bitterness in the finish"
"Nice smooth beer.  Clean but not watery. Leap years above Bud/Coors/Miller crap.
Great on a hot day."
"Very good beer.  My favorite Czech beer available in the US, but I will say that this tasted better in the Czech Republic, which isn’t surprising.  Has a little bite to it, and you can really taste the cleanliness in it’s bite.  This beer is great on a very warm day, b/c it makes me feel refreshed."
"A pretty good, smooth pilsner. Hadn’t had this in a long time and when in my head I lined it up against some other widely produced pilsners it came out ahead. Smooth, tasty and easy to suck back. I would only want this rally cold and fresh - I’m guessing that would be best."
"Another beer Miller got thier paws on, Taste is great one of my favorites. Plenty of taste I have heard it said that when this brew used to be shipped over from Czech, it would be at its best if it was kept cold throughout the journey across the sea, into the distributor, into the store and to the customer. Taste its very best when served icy cold"
"Can from StFun! Golden yellow color, small head. Taste is a smooth, clean, and fresh. Small amount of hops and malt. To be honest not much to write about, but still a good pilsner. Better than any macro. Thanks Josh!"
Draught at Boulder Junction.  Came way too cold in a pint glass.  Golden yellow with minimal head.  Mild hoppy aroma. Semi-bitter finish.  Better as it warmed.  I’ll make a note to try it again someday soon.
"Pours a golden yellow color, slightly grassy aroma.   Sligthly fizzy white head dissipates fairly quickly.   Hoppy, and slightly grapefruity, with a good crisp taste for a Pilsner.   Not a particularly complex or notable taste, but a standard Pilsner benchmark."
"Tasted 11/02/2008. 330ml bottle from Regional Wines and Spirits. Pours a bright pale gold with a disappearing white head. Floral and spicy hops dominate the nose, with a gorgeously rich buttery biscuit aroma underneath. Rich, complex malt in the mouth - a hint crusty. Firm herbal hop character hints at lemon and pepper. Firm lingering bitterness, tending strong.  Very very good - just lacking some zippy vitality. A benchmark beer that is head and shoulders above any other classic Pilsner I’ve tried, and would certainly be well above 4 if it were fresh."
"A ""macro"" style beer for those who like craft beer. Pors and looks much like a Bud/Coors/Miller. Tastes *similar* to these, but with no water or corn flavors. The flavor is actually malty and smooth, slightly bitter on the back end. Pretty refreshing as well. Considering this is just slightly higher than Bud at my local store, this is a great party alternative."
malty with moderate hop bitterness.  good aroma of fruit and malt.  very nice dark yellowish color.
Can. Pours clear golden. Somewhat hoppy nose with some fruit. Bitter taste with notes of grass and malt. Good pilsener.
"Pours clear golden blond.  A sweet fruity nose, mainly apples, with a small hint of bitterness.  A light grassy bitter flavor with a mild undiscernable sweetness.  A very watery mouthfeel.  Not bad, but just not really my style."
"Light Saaz aroma, some almost-DMS-y pilsner malt aroma. Clean, well balanced bitterness, some toasty decoction flavour. Saaz. Nice balanced beer. Only slightly stale this time."
"massively overrated. not bad, but would struggle to get above ’average’. there simply aren’t enough hops to stop it being overly sweet, and this pasteurised version is just too flat and cardboard in flavour"
"One of my all time favorites, a welcome and well deserved classic reputation. An almost narcotic nose, pungent, full and rising with the noble Saaz hops dominating. Crisp, golden color, clean and balanced carbonation with a rather nice but rapidly diminishing head. Some Bavarian lace on the sides of a tall pilsner glass, but again a bit sparse. Flavor is refreshing, clean and pleasantly bitter, filling the mouth and sides of the tongue with a rich, malty sweetness. Palate is smooth, richly bitter and lingering. A very pleasant aftertaste that begs for another deep draw, a call better served by…"
"This is one of my favourite beers!!! Even though it is only 4.4%abv, it still has a very full flavour to it. Delicious!!!"
"[WBA styles tasting] Clear amber color, with a very foamy white head. Hoppy, malt and cereal grain aroma- almost like sweet wort. Flavors are crisp, dry, with a strong bitterness. Slight diacetyl, but it seems to balance the hops well. Dry finish. Hoppy."
Poured a golden color with a quickly dissapting head. Spicy and malty taste which quickly turns into bitter hops. Lots of carbonation in this crisp and refreshing beer.
"Can: Cloudy gold pour with a frothy white head.  The nose is full of Noble hops - spicy with wet grass undertones.  The body is very caramelly, with a nice balance of hops.  For a lower ABV lager, this was very tasty."
"12oz bottle. Pilsner lovers, this is it. Pours a bright, deep gold with a nice white head. Head doesn’t last as long as I expected, but leaves a nice white lace on the glass. Malt & hops in the nose in perfect balance. Crisp, clean taste, with a near-perfect balance of sweet malt and those wonderful Saaz hops. OK, I’m biased, and was even before I did this rating, as it isn’t the first time I’ve enjoyed ""the orignial"". I’d love to try this one on tap. Pilsner, or pilsener, is my favorite style, and this is the one all of the rest are measured by."
A light and spicy malt flavoring makes this an easy drinking beer. A somewhat tart flavoring.
"Bottle given to me by my work colleagues. Golden with a, quickly dispersing, frothy white head. Malty toffee, barley and hops in the nose, no aforementioned skunkyness though. Taste is much the same, not crisp and hoppy as I expected, more malt and toffee than anything with some late bitter hops in the finish. Hopefully will get to try this fresh from the source at some point, I’m quite interested in the contrast."
This beer is pretty good. I love the hoppage. It tastes fresh and kind of earthy. Has a bit of a strong taste on the finish. A beer worth trying!
Can. Light golden colour with a white head. Some malts and hops on the nose. The flavour is malty (toasted white bread) with a distinctive bitterness. The finish is bitter.
"One of the better Pils.  Nice aroma, decent hop character.  I’ll take one if you’re buying."
Brilliant crisp clear gold. Way more aromatic than I thought. Flavor was a spicier and had a bigger bite than expected. With such a low alc% I was not prepared for the amount of flavor and kick this beer had. Nice.
"(Czech Republic) Golden color with Med-Head, the beer has a Grassy taste and a bitter finish , but nice!!!  good with a meal."
"from a 12 oz bottle. Aroma is very dominant of hops. Flavour is a pleasantly bitter with a well-balancing citrusy malt body. An EXTREMELY well-rounded beer with qualitites worthy of a session, or just a refresher after a hot day. damn good beer. A definite stape for me."
"this is the best. The first. And the survival.
They made this beer a long time at the first beer making method.
Now they make it more modern, but they always have a can made in the old way, which they compare the beer made on the moden way to."
Clear golden with tiny white head. Aroma is mild hoppy with mlty notes. Fruity flavor with slight malty and hoppe notes.
"The classic. Very light golden pour with frothy head. Aroma of sweet malts and yeast.  Very smooth tatse, with a nice bitter finish."
"Aroma is grassy with a hint of maltiness. Appearance consists of a large, frothy, off-white head with deceenet lacing but lacks retenetion. Body is a burnt golden hue. Flavor is largely malty with sour and salty notes out back. Mouthfeel is watery with fizzy carbonation."
"it looks the same going in as it does coming out. smells ""beery"" according to my friend. slick feel,"
Light amber pour with nice white fluffy head. Armoa of light maltiness and a bit of sweetness. Flavor is light malt as well with a pretty good bitter finish. The flavor and aroma were a surprise in that there was no corn or wet paper. The other surprise was the decent bitter. Carbonation was decent. One of those beers I would really like to try very fresh on tap. A pleasant surprise.
"Bottle, bought @ Delhaize.
Yellowcolor, with white head. For a pils it’s a good beer. Aroma lots of malt and a bit hops.
Thin body. Taste sweet, herbal hops,…"
this is an excellent pilsner. It has a nice hoppy smooth taste and aroma. A beer that goes good with ant food or event.
"Pours a gold color with a white head.  Has a hop aroma, bitter taste.  Not bad, but im not a pilsner fan."
This is one of the better pilseners that I’ve had but its still not over the top.
"Virtually no aroma, which is a pleasant change from overly fragrant beers.  clear, deep gold color.  A little sour/bitter on the tongue.  Light body is offset by the sour aftertaste which limits it from all day drinkability A bitter, long finish is what will be taken away."
This beer was poured into a pilsner glass with a decent head to it. had a smell of fruit and hops. The taste was of apple and malt and very smooth on the throat. I liked the apple taste it stayed on the back of your toung for a while which i really enjoyed. I am a big fan of the sazz hops used in the making of this. They give it that right amount of bitterness.
"Aug. 2006 - I can understand the reputation this beer has.  Nice head, light color.  Hoppy with a nice sweetness underneath.  Pretty complex for a pils.  Some grass and hay hops.  Had a skunkyness to it, but not sure if it was the hops or the dastardly bottle.  I bet this would be really good on tap."
Pours a bubbly golden with a big white head.  Aroma is a slightly skunky pale malt and hops.  Taste is light and malty with the hoppy crisp pilsner finish of most czech pils.  I love this stuff but it has to be one of the most overpriced beers.
"I’ll be daggone if I see it, at least in the bottles they ship to America.  I think this beer put out Michael hair when it was one fire and thats why he likes it so much.  Light colored, frequently skunked, even on draft I don’t see it.  Some what bitter finish, not enough malt for me in a pilsener."
"Light amber with a nice head and a nice hoppy aroma. The flavour is hoppy with a very nice bitterness. Pure hops - in the Czech way. (Early rating, too short)"
"Rerate:   On tap in Prague.   I was expecting to be blown away in comparison to the green bottles that I had sampled this from in Sweden, but that was not the case.   In all fairness, it was served a little too cold on a cold december night, and I think that that might have taken away from the experience.   Or maybe it was the slew of unfiltered, microbrewed pilsners that I had on the same trip.   Regardless, one of the cleanest, crispest, most drinkable beers ever, with an uncanny balance.   But... It seems sterile and unpersonal.   Now I need the unfiltered version; should have made it down to…"
"Bottle.  Pours a clear dark golden in color with a medium diminishing off white head.  The aroma is floral hops and a touch of malt.  lavor is dry bitter hops with the complimentary malts to help out.  Definetly not my style, although one of the better pilsners (I guess)."
"Very good Pilsner, crisp and refreshing.  Golden coloring with a nice white foamy head.  I had this awhile back in a bar in Philly and just recently picked up a sixer and forgot how good this was."
Bright golden. White head that completely disappeared. Hoppy aroma. Oily texture. A sweet bitter aftertaste. Refreshing. KI=3
Pilsner Urquell is a classic example of an European Pilsner. I found it a little dry
"I haven’t had this in many years but still a good pils. yeasty aroma, true pils color and tight foamy head do a good job of expressing this version of the classic beer"
"Poured golden with a white head (which dissipated almost completely). Aroma is the epitome of beer. Smells of bread, hops, and malt. Flavor is malt well balanced with hops. Mouth feel is nice and full with a mostly dry finish. A great everyday session beer."
"Bottle. Golden yellow color with a white head. Aroma: Sweet malt, honey, grain, grass, butter and light hops. Flavor: Smooth and crisp, citrus, grass, honey, butter, herbal hops. Dry finish."
"Poured a perfect golden color with a quickly receding white head. sweet hoppy aroma. More of a bitter aftertaste than other Czech Pils i’ve had, but still good. I don’t like this one as much as Budvar, but its right up there."
"This famous Czech beer pours a beautiful golden color with lots of bubbly effervesance  topped with a creamy white head that mostly dissapates. Its faint aroma was that of hops. Its taste is refreshing, crisp and clean to the palate, with a creamy texture. It finshes with a slightly hoppy and smooth aftertaste. A great companion to lunches, light suppers or snacks."
Had is right there in the Czech.  It was pretty straightforward and light.  Has that bavarian malt flavor to it that I’m not the biggest fan of.  But it’s not bad nonetheless.
"Poured from a 12oz bottle and served in a lager glass.  This beer poured a crystal clear dark golden with a one-finger thick head of white foam that slowly faded away.  Almost no lacing.  The aroma of the beer was made up of biscuit, grass, and a refreshing citrus note.  The flavor consisted of sweet malt, biscuit, and dry, mildly bitter hops.  The mouthfeel was light-bodied and crisp with moderate carbonation.  An enjoyable, highly drinkable beer."
Straw colored with thin quickly dissipating head. Aroma is light and is slightly sweet with some old grassy hops. Very carbonated. Not one of my favorite styles but would serve well in hot weather.
"500ml bottle. Pale amber with a thick, loose, white head, heavily caronated; floral hop aroma; soft, soapy texture, slightly woody flavour; dry finish."
"Pours gold with a decent head.  Aroma of bread and green bottle.  Flavor of green bottle,  sweet malts,  and grass.  Finishes refreshing,  decently carbonated.  Good."
"this is a decent beer. ""the first true pilsner"". golden yellow color with a bready taste."
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a nice thick white head.  Very appealing for a pale beer.  Nose is crisp grassy hops.  Flavor is very crisp, and has a very bitter finish.  It’s a little sweet at the start and has just the slightest hint of spicyness.  It’s a little bit dry somewhere in the middle but not too bad.  Carbonation is pretty high, but in a nice way, and it’s not real thick, but again, it probably shouldn’t be."
"Can’t believe I’ve never entered a rating for this beer.  Aroma is bready, with some cereal grains, and clean profile, with a bit of European hop aroma.  pours golden with white head, and is really striking in some ways.  flavor is clean, with a nice balance of cereal malts, and herbal and grassy hops and a touch of DMS.  medium bodied.  they’re are better things around, but its still good."
"Soft aroma.
Golden colour with low or no-foam.
Bitter flavor with bitter notes in palate too.
Fresh beer to drink with any meal."
Bottle. A beer with a clear dark yellow color but ufortunatly almost no head. It has a slightly hoppy aroma - and the nice bitter flavor of hops.
"I’ve had fantastic bottles of this stuff, I’ve had awesome glasses of kegged PU, and I’ve had bad bottles as well.  Crisp bitterness, mild hop aroma, wonderful malt .. this is my favorite lager by far.  A more refreshing beer I’ve not had.  The canned version is much better than the bottles, it retains the malt character this beer should have that balances the bitterness much better than the stuff I’ve had in bottles."
"Color is a typical clear pilsner amber, a little darker than most I have seen. Aroma is firm and malty, not strong but still inviting. Flavor is crisp, malty, typical of a pilsner but a little richer than the average brew of this type. Refreshing, enjoyable, good with lunch or dinner."
"Bottle.  Pours clear golden with white fluffy head.  Slighly sweet, crisp, mellow hops.  Lively on the palate."
330ml bottle. Gold with a rapidly diminishing head. Malty aroma with a hop undertone. Peppery hop taste. Bit sweet but long aftertaste. Decent for a macro pilsner.
"330ml bottle. Bright golden colour with a short-lived white head and moderate carbonation. Stilted aroma of sweet malt and floral hops. Flavour had some doughy malt, a touch of sweetness and a tired hop finish. Ok."
"For some strange reason, I have had terrible luck trying to rate this beer.  Whenever I get a bottle and sit down to it, something goes wrong - it does not taste right, or I have a cold and can’t taste anything, or I have had one too many to do a serious rating . . . By the way, I do have some ethics when it comes to tasting beer.  After you have had a few, your taste buds are not in the best shape.  I don’t really trust these guys who have rated 5,000 plus beers.  They must have been smashed during at least half of those ratings.  Anyway . . . Because of these experiences, I have this idea that P.U. i…"
"Can 0.5 l. A bit darker golden with fizzy head, not much nose. Flavor is strange mixture of buttery, slightly funky and crispy hoppiness. The combination works tho and it’s very enjoyable. I can’t remember detecting the buttery fullness before, just the crispiness. Beautiful, strangely balanced for such a mess of flavors. Tap version is smoother and less crisp having especially nice hoppy aftertaste, like german pils."
Pale golden with a small head that disapears quickly.  Light aroma with a medium body.  A little bitter toward the finish.  From a beers of the world pack.
"Pale golden colour, small white head. Aroma is hoppy. Flavour has some grass hops. Smooth, and has a nice bitterness"
"500ml can. Pale golden with a medium disappearing white head. Nice fresh hoppy aroma. Nice, refreshing hoppy, grassy malt flavor. Medium body, a bit oily. One of the better pilsner around."
"(this rating from can) Aroma is clean, dry, and slightly metallic. Pours golden with a nice head but does not leave lace. Mouthfeel is spiky. Taste is peppery and bitter. Overall it’s alright but after having it unfiltered at the brewery, fuggetaboutit."
The best beer brewed in the world.  It is even better from the keg.  If you only had one beer to have on a deserted island this is my choice.  Its great cold or warm.
Bottle. Clear golden colour with a huge mostly lasting white head. Rich malty aroma and taste with a nice lasting bitterness. Good beer.
Very solid beer. Defintely purchase again. Have enjoyed this beer since I started drinking due to a detective in one of my favorite books who drank this beer. Lovely
Pours a medium to light golden with a small white head.  Very citrusy hops but medium hop addition.  very smooth and pretty delicious.  would buy again.  Great pilsner.  Happy that I have finally tried it.
"Pours clear golden with slight white head. Aroma is honey-like, grassy and slightly flowery hops. Taste is maltiness upfront, light, oily citric-like bitterness followed by a dry lingering bitterness in the aftertaste."
golden pour with no head just a tiny layer of froth.  malts and some slight hops on the nose.  not extremely thin but a very interesting taste.
"Why pilsners are put into green bottles seems silly to me, just asking for light damage.  Pours yellow and fizzy with an off-white head.  The aroma is clean with semi-sweet pale malt along with light grassiness.  Body is light with lots of fizzy carbonation bordering on being over carbonated.  Taste starts with semi-smooth pale malt, some sourness and light skunk.  The finish has a bit of spice, but far too much sour skunkiness.  Adequate at best. (6/3/5/2/12 - 2.8)   Rerate notes  Got a canned version and it is considerably cleaner and grassier with richer malt than expected for this be…"
"Golden body, light head. Slightly hopped flavor gives it some character. All in all, a very versatile beer. I can see why it is the classic example of the style.."
"if you like the hoppy taste, you must bring this. Gold color, little head. Some malt and yeast, but the hop dominate the floral flavour. Little body, hop in the aftertaste too."
"This is the mother of all Pilseners.  Draught several notches above bottled.  (Not for the impatient if properly tapped.  Providing proper carbon dioxide pressure is an art.  If you are offered a stein, you are in the wrong place.)  They got world’s best hops and superior water right down the road, and unadulterated barley, too.  True, they took some of the meatiness out over the years, like when white wines went the fashionable, lean route, but not as much as many others, so there is still a richness here that reminds you of how distinct a classic Pilsnener could and should taste."
"The first time I tried this three years ago it was very flavorful. Bitter hop notes, etc. Now is tastes more like a hyped lager. Not much flavor or distinction."
"Draught in Prague.  Pours pale golden with frothy white head.  Aroma is slightly fruity with simple hop note.  Nice clean flavor.  Very refreshing, with gentle hop note at the end."
"Ahhhh....This first known pilsner, known among all beer enthusiast. This was a very nice looking beer...poured a nice pale yellow color, nice smooth taste of malt, nice head retention. Hop’s noticible. Very nice palate feel with medium carbonation. Will buy again."
"Fruity but not sweet malt. Clean hoppy paste with moderate avg. bitter finish. Avg. frothy head. Pleasant light-to-medium body. Superb pilsener, second only to the unfiltered version (not available in my area)."
"Bottle at Stuff Yer Face. Pale golden pour. Half inch white head. Crisp, clean hoppy taste. Had a bit of skunkiness to it. This beer is probably diifficult to get fresh in the states. That may explain it. Overall, good beer. Probably wouldn’t be running out to buy a 12 pack but would have it again."
"Bottle 33 cl. Pours a pale clear golden with a medium white head and an aroma of malt and hops. Taste is really flavored for a pilsener, sweet and hoppy, with a nice bitter finish. Best ""bigger"" pilsener I ever had"
"Bottle.  Pours clear and sparkling gold with an average, fizzy, white head, lasting with good lacing.  Aroma is heavy malt (hay, straw, grain), average hops (flowers, grass), and average yeast (sweat).  Light bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Average duration, light sweetness, acidity, and bitterness."
"King of Plisners.....no other mass produced beer comes close to this.

It is full of flavour, and goes down easily. I have offered this beer to many friends and visitors and without exception always received positive comments"
"A very famous beer – all pilsners are named after it. The bottle looks really good. Not as much alcohol as German pilsners. Fresh and modest spicy, not too dry – a good beer."
"Dark gold,small head,not lasting,good carbonation.Aroma,nutty ,honey mushroom,flavour lemony magnificent saaz hops,grain flavour very nice pils.Had a few sessions on this one,will have a few more.Oh! finish is fresh and tangy to me."
"Wow this is a nice Pilsner.... then why the low rating?  This isn’t a real flavorful beer, and though the color is nice, there’s no head to speak of.  Lightly hopped, balanced bittering, slight notes of malt.  Think of this as a real beer drinkers ""lite"" beer, a lawnmower beer.  I do enjoy it, but when I’m looking for flavor or something to pair with my traditionally spicy food I look elsewhere.  I might add I have a hard time finding these not skunked, but on the good side the impact of skunking on this beer is mostly in the aroma, effecting flavor very little."
"Saaz hops aroma gets your first.  Dry, bitter, crisp.  Not bad, but not great.   Refreshing at low temperatures."
"Tap: Terrible. 

Aroma is similar to a bad malt.
Awesome aquisition, Miller…"
a descent pale lager here.  i once again dont understand how this is classified as bohemian pilsner when its no different from all the american lagers
"Bottle.  Skunked.  Bought single from a local grocery store.  Stupid Green bottles.  Aroma, after you get past the black and white striped stinky cat is grains and hops.  Can’t detect too much else with the eau de toillet de skunk.  (Did I mention the beer was skunked?).   Appearance is a crystal clear golden yellow.  small white head, dissipated rather quickly.  minimal lacing is evident.  First sip, ruined by that damn mammal again.  This one is going down the drain.  I was warned by LTJudge that he has gotten a few skunks on this one too, but I had hoped for better.  I really want to…"
"Pilsner Urquell is a clear, sparkling golden lager with a slightly off-white and slightly oily, foamy head that slowly fades to a splotchy film and leaves good lacing.  The aroma is of lemon and fresh barley.  There is a hint of sweet malt and something fruity and grassy.  It’s a little muted.  It has a smooth, slick, medium-light body with a clean finish.  It’s a bit prickly on the tongue.  The flavor is a nice, full and round, fruity, wooden, lemony hop that never overwhelms.  Everything is very mellow.  There is a little tart/sweet flavor from the malt.  Damn fine session lager.  Total party beer."
"Pours golden with a small foamy white head. Aroma of hops. Taste is flowery, hops, grainy, crisp, bitter. A nice pilsner."
Bottle:  Low alcohol is more fitting with a summer brew.  But overall not a bad drink.
"The first Pilsener, according to the bottle. Great, hoppy beer works as an excellent thirst quencher. Good beer for a summer afternoon after a long day’s work. Quite bitter hopping combines with enough malt to make a nice flavour and palate. Recommended."
this is a very good pilsner it is a little weak because of its low alcohol content but syill very good. it is an easy 7 out of 10 in my books.
"ON tap at the Yard House in Irvine.  Wish I could get some of the unfiltered version.  Still, this is a great example of the style.  Hop finish is just very well done and overall it displays good balance.  A good thirst quencher."
Copying from my tasting notes. Bottle. Nice yellowish pour with a nice white head. Hoppy aroma. Taste is nice and bitter but balanced well by the malt.
"I have tried this beer twice now and can describe it with one word: SKUNKY!  Why don’t all beer manufacturers use brown bottles?  This might be a good beer if it is protected from the light from the point of manufacture until the point of consumption, however in my 2 samples, this didn’t happen.  I try never to drink out of clear or green bottles because of the ’skunkiness’ caused by the light.…"
"Poured a nice burnished yellow with a fine off white head and plenty of lace. Good hoppy malty aroma. Flavor has plenty of grainy malty slightly sweet flavore that balanced with a generous bitterness. Decent carbonation and finish. Great session beer. Very clean. Had this one on draft at Bodega Brew Pub downtown La Crosse, WI."
"500ml can. Nice golden colour with a pure white, quickly receeding head. Very nice floral hoppy aroma with grassy citrus notes. Taste has a slight malty sweetness, kind of like Wonderbread at the start, but is quickly overpowered by the long bitter hop finish. Mouthfeel is thin but about as robust as posible from a pils. Refreshing but not outstanding"
Nice hoppy aroma.  Hops definately dominate the flavor as well.  Nice refreshing beer.
"Reminds me of my first German Pils; thin, bitter, and stinky, just not as good.
Decent for the style, but really now; why would anyone drink more than one of these, regardless of what else was available (Listerine anyone)?
I’m guesing that in a blind taste test (minus all the ""original Pilsener"" hype) this one would score MUCH lower than it has.…"
............................................................................
"Clear yellow hue with frothy white head, smooth, light, dry and crisp, bitter smell and aftertaste."
"Nov 7th on tap at capital ale house richmond va... pours an inviting light golden color with an aroma that was neither light or overpowing but rather mundane.  The taste however, was smooth and crisp, very crisp with an even finish..  good starter  or ender  I now understand how a good pilsner should taste."
"Pours gold with a small head. Aroma is at first very skunky, settling into caramel and corn. Light and malty scent. Flavour begins with light caramel malts, and a pleasant hoppiness takes over almost immediately. Very well balanced. The aftertaste is fairly bitter. Medium bodied. Quite clean. The taste is not the least bit complex... but the balance is almost exquisite. I’m thinking session beer here."
"Rated while drinking: Pours goldenrod with a thin but fluffy white cap, and nice lacing. Crisp, hoppy, and bread in the aroma. Yum. Solid flavor, flowing from malts into hops. Tasty as a pils can be. Surprisingly hardly any skunk (purchased in an enclosed sampler package). Crisp, nice carbonation, and a hint of bitterness. Great beer for a great price."
"Draft @ U Vejvodu, Prague.  Served in massive stein with similarly massive dense pure white head, color changing from deep amber to crystalline gold depending on the angle, much hoppier on the nose than its only real competition, Budweiser Budvar, clear, medium body, leafy green saaz hops on the nose, light graham malts, biscuity, long bitter resiny finish.  More character than B.B. if slightly less quaffable, but an inimitable standard for the style.  Like any true pilsner, It really is a beer best enjoyed fresh."
"Had a little overkill of the Urquell on a recent romp through Prague and the Czech Republic but when its fresh its substantially better. I’ve always enjoyed this as a basic beer with a clean hoppiness crisp, dry finish."
"Good Lord, thanks for this good beer. So crisp, so clean, i could imagine swimming in this. The taste is like a whispy cloud, so thin, but its substance tickles you. Skunky, but a hint of melon."
"Faint hop aroma and in some cases skunky.  Pours yellow with a poor white head.  Not a lot to taste here, avereage pilsner body with a refreshing crispness.  I was expecting a little more hop flavor but I guess I am spoiled on APA.  Easy drink with quenching qualities when you can find one that isn’t skunky in the states.  Overall good example of a Pilsner, just not my favorite style."
"500 mL can. Pours nice golden colour, though very little head, leaves a ring. Smell is of sharp hops and some honey and flower. Taste is an interesting balance between smooth hops and a slight bitterness. Also a note of honey in there. Surprisingly kind of slow drinking, not something I’m used to in a pilsener. Not exactly the best pilsener in the world I guess, but it didn’t dissapoint me."
"pours golden yellow with a white lacy head - aroma of light hops with honey and bread - flavor is very crisp with hints of grass and sour grapefruit and a slightly bitter finish - get it in a can, not the green bottle"
Great pilsner. Can’t wait to go to Plzen and try them all. I don’t think i’ve ever had anything quite like it. Very unique taste with a fast fading aftertaste. Very good slightly chilled.
I don’t understand the hype around this beer. It’s in my opinion just another lager - although slightly better than most commercial lagers. The aroma has a bit of hops which is more than the average. The flavor is not that good it has a bit more complexity than most lagers.
"Pours nice golden with white head that doesn’t last. Smell is sweet honey maltiness , and very doughy breadiness, with maybe a faint touch of hops.  Some grassy and citrus hops in the aroma. Slightly carbonated taste dominated by hops, light citrus, and bread as well, with a lightly bitter finish. A classic beer."
"Pint can. Pours clear gold with a fluffy white head. Pine and floral aroma with a bit of biscuit. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Taste starts buscuit sweet, but ends in flowers and pine/  Kinda hoppy for a megabrew but the malt balances it out nicely."
"Deeper golden than some pilsners & I immediately notice the aroma, bigger nose than most I’ve tried lately. Subtle hop and a stronger malt fragrance. Virtually no head, though bubbly. A little lemon, rounder feel in the mouth. This is definately an easy drinker! Very refreshing! Too bad it’s kinda expensive. Gotta catch it on sale."
Usually this is a pretty good beer.   Sometimes it can be a little skunky.  A lot of malt in the aroma and a nice balance from the herbal hops.  Pretty tasty.
"I found this in a down town collage bar? Skunky aroma, typical almost boring pilsner flavor with a hint of lemon lime and bitterness. I would call this a “small” beer."
"Wow, this beer actually has a nice and rich malty aroma to it. The aroma is quite pleasing. I just love the use of the malts and hops. For a commercial beer this one has the best smell, and again that iis for commercial beer. A orange color that looks like beer. Nothing special about the appearance. The head fades away the beer looks quite carbonated, and that is about all I can say as far as the appearance goes. The beer has a nice upfront bittering flavor that just hits ever bitter tastebud that could be fathomed, but the malty flavour is not in the taste as it is in the aroma. This beer has…"
"Bottle/Draft.  Great beer to enjoy in Prague.  Light palate and very clean flavor, with quick finish/after-taste.  Much better on draft than in bottle."
"Pretty clear yellow orange. No head. A little undercarbonated. Tastes like a good Heineken. I don’t know about ""unparalleled exceptionality"", but perfectly drinkable. Much better pilsners available (though few as easy to find)."
"Decent pilsener.  Pours clean, clear, and crisp.  Lots of carbonation.  Little head retention.  Short finish.  Sort of dry, but crisp.  Depictive of this style.  Refreshing."
12oz bottle. dark golden color. medium head quickly fades. mild hops and euro malt aroma. smooth malt with crispy bitter bite towards the end. nice finish. i drink a lot of this when i’m in Poland with family. 50 cents amercian for a 1/2 litre. i wish it was that cheap in Vegas. very good pilsner!
"Aroma: virtually nonexistent. Solid straw color with little to zero head. Flavorwise, light, refreshing, almost like cider, and seems like it would make a good stand-in for sparkling wine or some of the sweeter whites. A better-than-the-rest picnic beer. EDIT: Goes wonderfully with raw almonds."
Bottle. Pours a clear golden with a large white head that fades to a ring leaving good lacing. Aroma of Saaz hops and sweet pils malt. Taste is the same as aroma. Medium thin mouthfeel with a medium amount of bitterness. Very good.
if I could afford to drink this beer like water i would.God please let this beer be in heaven.Pilsner Urquell is a gift from the gods.Gimme a call!
"Well, all started with this one!. God bless Pilsner Urquell for been the pioneer of pilsener beers. I even went to Plzen (Pilsen) in the Czech Republic and visit the old factory were this beer was born. If muslims have to go to Meca before they died. Pilsener lovers have to do the same with Plzen!. Golden beer with a strong taste, a little bitter, but very well balanced in flavor and palate."
"Pilsener Urquell is one of those things people love to defend.  I would agree with those noble altruists that it is something like a fragile child in a world of more muscular, mature and intelligent beers.  I simply disagree about nurturing its confidence back using self-defeating lies.  It isn’t a pale lager, and has no business scratching desperately for mediocrity with that lot, but I don’t think it’s the paramount example of Pils primacy that particular members portray it as.  My notes on the beer are brief, as was the time I had with it, but they are not complimentary.  It was a clear and lucid…"
Bottle. Nose is strong grassy malts with a touch of hop character. Clear golden. Flavor is excessively well balanced with a strong but drinkable palate.
"Ok...let me start by saying I bought a 4-pack of 16oz cans at a local liquor store...I had never seen this beer in cans before. There exists a charming appeal when a decent beer is placed in a can that I cannot really explain...I am not sure if my dick was playing tricks on me, but it tasted supernaturally good, ice cold, in the can...much better than the omnipresent bottles...My advice, order the cans from the local package store and shove the bottles into your wife’s cunt."
"12 ounce bottle purchased at Total Wine Fort Lauder Very Good!dale, FL. $1-79"
"Probably my favourite lager.
I find most lagers have a bit of a watery feel to them (light bodied) but not this one. This lager drinks like an ale.
Nice colour, and I find the aroma quite hoppy, in a flowery sort of way, as well as the taste.…"
"Crisp, clean, refreshing.  Bitter and pleasant from start to finish with a very light aftertaste.  Aromas are very subtle."
"Poured a nice gold with some slight orange hue to it. A small head poured as well, but withered down to a small ring quickly. Smells hoppy, and somewhat floral (tinge of grass).

Nice bitter taste, and I mean strong bitter, just the right amount. Feels and tastes cri…"
"330ml bottle.
Could smell this one as soon as I popped it open. Aroma is a hoppy goodness with a little sweet, grassy note. Pours a nice amber influenced gold, with a full but dissipating white head.
Taste is hop bitter with a nice balance of sweet citrus flavour. Nice body and nice…"
"Nice beer for a pilsner, has plenty of flavor and drinks really nice.  Good beer for a hot day."
"Bottle: I drank it straight from the bottle as a good pilsner should be sampled. (didn’t know I had never rated it). The smell was sweet grassy slight hoppy aroma. The taste was superb...smooth, malty, grainy, just enough zing to keep me interested. So far the Czech pilsners are my favorite by far, sorry Germany!"
"Aroma is lacking.  Malt is a bit soapy, but the bitter and aftertaste is very nice.  It leaves you with that great pilsner wanting more- good thing it’s only 4.4abv b/c they go back easy."
"Better than most or all of the mass-produced pilsners.  A good, strong aroma with earthy, straw hops and some subtle fruit tones too.  It is a clear, light, crisp gold color with a smaler-sized, foamy white head.  The flavor is quite bitter and strawish, with a bit of sourness; not sweet.  Good, lively carbonation that fizzles on the palate, and good going down.  For some reason, it’s just better in the 22 oz bottles."
"WOW.......simply a great beer.  I was a bit skeptical about this as I have had some pretty shitty pilsners before, but this stuff is great.  Everything you could want from a Pilsner: refreshing, flavorful, complex yet extremely drinkable.  This certainly earns it’s rep for being the yardstick of Pilsners."
"A very refreshing pilsner best enjoyed in warm weather months.  Tastes slightly of citrus.  Golden color, it pours with a nice head that does not linger long."
"Pours a bright straw burnished golden hue witha decent white head. Aroma of well balanced grains and Saaz hops. From a can, this beer can not be beat! Finishes crisp, complex, and well rounded"
"Pours a clear yellow body with a small fizzy white head. Aroma of grass and a slight hoppiness. Flavor is lightly bitter, sort of a mild sweet and sour deal. Refreshing and easy to drink."
"Interesting beer.  Reminiscent of most higher-class German beers, this Czech beer is a winner.  Crisp flavor at first drink, finishes with a deeper, smooth flavor; it leaves you wanting more."
"Gentle taste with a buttery finish, reminiscent of a grandmother’s freshly baked biscuit. As it is the original pilsner, it’s necessary to hold it to higher standards than most, and with that in mind I have no hesitation in saying that this is what true Pilsner should taste like. Fantastic."
"Fantastic beer that goes down smooth and hits the spot every time. Great hoppy flavor that stays in your mouth long after the beer is finished. This is the ORIGINAL pilsner, and my favorite."
"A wonderfully refreshing and crisp beer that does the body good while the weather is hot. However, keep it the hell out of sunlight. If you don’t believe in ""skunked beer"" you will after leaving one of these unopened outside on the picnic table after an outside dinner then bring it inside to hit up the refrigerator, aaack! Otherwise it was good, nice carbonation level. Citrusy, a little sour."
"Bottle. Great flavor complimented by hoppy aftertaste. Pours golden with frothy white head. Typically not a fan of pilsners, but this is a great beer!"
"Bottle, pours a nice gold color with a little white head.  Aroma is light with hops.  Taste is malt and a touch of hops bitterness, a nice drinking Czech pils."
"Been drinking this beer off and on for 20 years and am just now getting around to rating.  Pours a deep golden color with a respectable fluffy white head.  It diminishes, but continues to ring the glass.  Aroma is bread dough and sweet hop flowers.  Taste is the sweetness of lightly toasted malt and a mild Saaz hop bitterness.  Still an excellent brew, but I think not quite as good as years past.  I’ve heard that since SABMiller bought them, some brewing is contracted to a brewery in Poland."
"Old world malts dominate the flavors and nose.  Nice consistency throughout the palate.  But like many beers that adhere to historic methods and recipes, this one is aggressive, indelicate, and rough on the palate.  Nice hop presence."
"Draft. Clear very pale body with a small, creamy, white head. The aroma is herbal, grassy and clean. The flavor is lightly bitter, fairly dry with herbal and grassy hops, a touch of dough and light cotton candy. Medium/light body is a bit thin with moderate carbonation."
"Deep yellow. Somewhat short white head. It has that special hoppy floral aroma which is archetypical of a bohemian pilsener (saazer...). Some maltyness. Faint notes of soap. Slightly bittter, dry finish."
12 oz. bottle - Thought I rated this awhile back.   Oh well.  Pours a crystal clear light golden color with a large white head.  The head leaves some nice lacing as it settles.  Very little  carbonation.  Aroma is grain and spicey herbal hops.  Flavor is a nice balance of lightly sweetened malt and herbal hops.  Light to medium body.  Probably one of the better Pils that is easy to obtain.  A good beer.
"Clear gold with an average head. Bitter Saaz aroma. Medium bodied. Bitter Saaz flavour also, although very well balanced by some sweet malt. Very tasty. Probably deserves it classic status."
"Is this how pilseners are supposed to taste?  Especially one as highly acclaimed as this. Way too skunky- subdue that skunk a bit and it’s a good brew.  I had 3 before i finally figured that it wasn’t just a bad bottle.  The positive aspects?  Crisp, clear, dry, nice carbonation.  BUT a bit too skunky."
Bottle.  A very good pilsner... from the birthplace of pilsner.  Would love to try the unfiltered version at the brewery... maybe one day.  This one has lively carbonation on the palate.... bitter and sweet as well.  Not too much aroma.
"A golden hazey  color with a thin head. the smell seems malty, hay, citrus, and floral. The taste is malty with a hint of floral citrus and hops. The finish is slitghtly bitter but mellows out for an easy drinking."
"Oh lunch beer, how I love thee.  Draught served in pint glass.  Large frothy white head diminishes slowly and leaves very nice lacing.  Average looking (density) body is mildly carbonated and a medium yellow in color.  Nose is of light malt (light bread, grain), moderate hops (perfume, herbs).  Taste shifts from sweet to spicy bitter with a long finish.  Body is medium density and very creamy.  Carbonation is soft.  Everything is as it should be with this brew; peppery hops, creamy mouthfeel, no harshness.  A great thirst quencher but not terribly interesting in the aroma / flavor…"
"Bottled (330 ml green bottle). I always buy this beer packaged in cardboard boxes and never came across one that was lightstruck. Deep gold colour with moderate  head that disapears quickly. Malt and floral hay aroma. Well balanced flavour of sweet malt and Saaz hop bitterness. Nice balanced bitter sweet hoppy finish. Refreshing. Very good, classic bohemian pilsner. This is my daily ""bread"" and I am  never be tired of it."
"Pours golden. Very small head that disappears very quickly. The smell is sweet with a touch of honey. The first thing I notice about the taste is there’s a good amount of carbonation, followed by a slight sweet taste and a very slightly bitter aftertaste. It’s a good beer for what it is but I’m not a big Pilsner fan."
As far as widely available brews go this one is pretty solid.  Dark golden color with little head.  Sweet aroma and a slightly bitter taste with little lingering afterwards.
"Pours a headless dull gold with a faint aroma of ginger. Taste is slightly spicy (again, ginger) with a muted sweetness balanced with an almost sour hop taste. Finish is dry with a touch of vinegar. Body is under-carbonated, thin, and lifeless. Not bad, just not my cup of tea."
"The standard for Pilseners.  From the tap in a damned dimpled mug (stupid Italian bar).  Pours a beautiful clean yellow color, with a little bit of head that dissipates quickly.  Aroma is malt, and there is malt present in the flavor too, but the finish is hops all the way, with just a tinge of copper (lines were probably dirty at the shithole bar)."
Surprising for a macro brew.  Weak aroma but not bad.  Pale gold in color.  Decent flavor but weak again.  Good feel and finish.  Very drinkable but for the price I can find better.
"The original.......nice bready aroma, with notes of grains, and corn. Flavour is much of the same. I would love to try the unfiltered version of this!"
Pours clear gold.  Notes of malt that goes into a very balanced and clean mouthfeel.  Hops show up but malt plays a role as well.  Nice dry finish.
"Pours a golden/oak color and forms a 1/2 finger head that disapated quickly. The nose is malty, nutty and clean. The taste is a malt/hop mix that is more malt than hop. Bready/wheat flavor is dominant and has a slight copper taste in the finish. It’s a pretty good Pilsner."
"12 oz. bottle in a Paulaner pilsner glass...beautiful effervescent bubbles through a softened golden body--head is thick and frothy...distinct, moderate malt/hops balance--inviting...slightly lagerish mouthfeel...pleasantly dry with a medium presence but challenging enough to escape pilsner ""same-dom""...slightly bitter flavor that holds on...a pleasant lingering!...Goldfine’s claim-- this is one of the six beers you will meet in heaven--holds up, as I can and have drunk this twelve months of the year in variously different situations, always with a consistent result, in bottle or on tap..."
"Appearance: blond color and some orange. Medium head, persistent, white color and good persistency.
Aroma: fruity-citric, pale malty and intensive floral-hoppy. Fruitiness of lemon, grapefruits and ripe pineapple. The hoppy I remember me the resinous of pine. Soft metallic touch, maybe the can.…"
"Draught.Pours a Pale Golden colour with a small fizzy white head and lots of active carbonation. Aroma is euro yeast, clove and hints of malts. Initital taste is bland with some of the yeast and bready notes that were similar to the aroma finishing with slight bitter hops. Definitely a refreshing beer, enjoyable but looking for more in the flavor and palate."
One of the better pilseners I’ve tasted. Seems to be the standard other pilsener aspire to. I will always consider this brew overrated however.
Bottle. Clear golden colour with large creamy white mostly lasting head. Aroma is malt and floral hops. Sweet flavor with hints of yeast. Bitter finish.
"Pint in Amsterdam, Bottle in the Us.  A lot of flavor going on here for a Pils.   Very bitter kick.  I got to give it props though, ive never had anything quite like it."
"The aroma gets better with the drinking, classic bread.  Is the archetype light straw colored pils.  The flavor is a bit more wort than I remember, but the same direct, unapologetic hop.   The lively carbonation is champagne-esque.  This has always managed to be the standard pils, and will probably be for some time to come."
"Pours a very slightly transparent golden amber. Had a slightly sour taste to it which I rather enjoyed that left almost no after taste. I don’t agree with the idea that this is an overly bitter beer, but then when I hear bitter I think about the IPA or ESB styles."
"Golden yellow Pilsner from the originators of the brewing method. I have drank this beer in both bottle and draft, and at the brewery from the wooden vats. It is a very easy drinking beer with a fluffy long lasting head, light taste, with plenty of bitter hop aftertaste. I prefer it on tap to bottle, as the bitterness is sometimes a bit too much from the bottle."
"Draft.  Crystal clear gold.  Large, pure white head that settles to a spotty film.  Scattered lacing on the glass.  Aroma is floral, with pale malts and pleasant notes of honey.  The flavor is again floral, with ample bitterness and an annoying, but not overwhelming astringency.  The taste lacks the honey notes that the aroma shows.  Body is on the watery side of medium, and the astringency makes for a slightly hard finish.  Average at best."
"A surprising pilsner out of the glass, it had an unsuspecting kick to it.  Little/no aftertaste, kept you wanting more."
"Had the great fortune to drink this in Prague, it was a great experience.No bells and whistles, just a great beer. Smooth with a great aftertaste that is slightly sweet."
"The pour was gold with the faintest of coppery highlights.  A one-finger tall white head that receded quickly and provided no lacing.  The aroma was sweet malt, yeast and a bit of floral hops.  The flavor was yeast, malt and bread with hops bailing it out on the finish."
"355 ml bottle.  Pours a glowing light cooper with a course white head.  Sweet, yeasty nose with a touch of pepper.  Medium body with a balance slightly to the sweet side.  A bit of bite from aggressive carbonation.  A clean classic pils."
"Pours nice golden with white head that doesn’t last.  Smell is sweet honey maltiness , and very doughy breadiness, with maybe a faint touch of hops.  Taste is a  touch hoppy, with a firm bitter bite up front with a doughy, yeasty aftertaste that I don’t care for. Very light bodied and ends slightly fuller with the aftertaste.  Not great, I thought after having it a second time."
"8/1/07 From the bottle.  Aroma is of bready malt, yeasty, followed by pepper spice floral saaz hops; all well blended.  Appearance is light gold with a low but persistant white head.  Flavor is bready malt forward with a good saaz hop balance, low bittering and some resiny notes.  Mouthfeel is lightly creamy with low/medium body and a low carb bite.  Overall, an easy drinking pils, but the slight resiny tone is annoying."
Average. Not a bad pilsner.. but that is not saying a lot. Maybe a tiny hint of clove/spice and honey here that gives it a discernible characteristic.
"[444-20070726] Sample @ LCBO-Summerhill. Light pipe smoke aroma wafts through piles of burnt hay and burnt marshmallow. Clear, yellow body with a quick foamy white head. Burnt malty hay flavour. Medium body. Not impressive, though has an interesting history."
"Golden coloured, nice carbonation. Very pleasantly hoppy, smooth and bitter flavour. It’s true what they say: when referring to Pils, this is the example."
"500ml can from LCBO, courtesy of a friend. Better than the average lager, on par with or better than Creemore. Nice touch of bitterness with a small amount of hops, accompanied with a bread-like taste. Decent stuff."
330 ml green bottle - Golden colour. Virtually no head. Unpleasant smell and taste. (Hope it’s not off - will have to try again one day to be sure). Sweet malty with a mild bitterness.  A bit disappointing after reading all tye great reviews.
Bottle. Golden amber in colour with a thin and rapidly disappearing white head. No strong flavours but has a sweet malty aftertaste. Thin to medium bodied with average carbonation. Bitter. A little watery.
Poured from a 12 oz bottle.  It had a beautiful clear golden color with a small white head that disappeared quickly.  The aroma was skunky and sweet like wet grass or hay.  The flavor was a bit on the bitter side but it was fairly strong.  I wasn’t greatly impressed with it.
"bitter flavor,skunky aroma, golden color

I always try beers twice, just in case I got an old batch,  This batch was really bitter,  I will probabley try again,"
"500 ml can. Pours clear golden with a small white head, mostly diminishing. Aroma is light malty with fresh and flowery hops. Nice hopbitter taste, slight sweet with a low maltprofile. Clean and crisp mouthfeel. Smooth bitter finish."
"500 ml can. Slightly cloudy golden color, thin white head. As soon as I put the glass under my nose I feel like I’m sitting in the middle of a Saaz hops field in Czech republic, amazing ! I can also detect an aroma of malt and citrus. After the first sip, the first thing I notice is how well balanced this beer is with its distinctive hops and malt with citrus. Nice, gentle, lasting bitter finish. Light to medium body, lively carbonation. All in all, this beer is pretty simple : hops, malt and citrus, but it is so well done that it’s amazing without being complex and original.  For my taste it’s world class."
"Bottle.  Pour is a orange/gold color with a two finger head that forms and then dies down without lacing.  A few bubbles drift up to the surface and the aromas are very pilsner like.  A little bit of a skunky smell at first, but it gives way to bread, grass and Saaz.  Flavor is about the same.  That nice peppery (almost like white pepper) bite from the Saaz waits till the end and gets you, finishing off a bready/grassy masterpiece."
"Obvious characteristics of a pilsener - golden color with noticeable carbonation and a frothy white head.  Aroma largely of Saaz hops.  Taste saaz with malt thrown in as well.  A smooth beer, though I find myself liking it less now than when I first tried it."
"Pours a standard pilsner, pale yellow with a good white head. The aroma is grassy, corn, sweet. Not much going on. The flavor is crisp and sweet, grassy too, skunky sort of. Crisp and clean on the palate. Definitely refreshing, not bad just not very good either."
Watery Pilsen. Lack flavor...................................................Pilsen aguada. Falta sabor.
"12 oz bottlebread, hay, golden, clear, frothy, light sweetness, lightly bitter, medium sourness, light body, thin feel, lively, nice crisp beer."
"Bottle.  Pours a light amber with a fine white head.  Nose is full of pale malts edged with a decent saaz hop bitterness.  Flavor is nothing to write home about....not exactly foul, but it’s nothing to write home about.   It’s an OK pilsener, but just OK."
"Well, i bought this beer at the local lcbo store in 500ml cans (bought 5).  Aroma is spicy malty and lots of malt flavor.  Color is nice dark brown.  No skunky smell.  Great beer.  Finished all 5 cans, will be hard to try different beer after this one, this will be my new regular beer.  All i can say is WOW!"
"In my professional opinion this is one of the best beers in the world. Aroma is spicey and floral from the saaz. Definately get a fresh bottle to avoid skunk. Great balance between bitterness and malt. Bitter, slightly astringent aftertaste, but very nice. This is a perfectly made beer."
"This beer was deep gold with a thin white head. It was also fizzy.  I really got no aroma from it, but that’s me. I don’t have a strong sense of smell. As for taste, I found it   moderately hoppy and citrusy (lemon maybe?) with what I can only describe as a gum taste."
"0,33 bottle.
Mustard yellow, greasy head. smell of grass, bitter start, broad fruity taste, soft palate, if all lagers had made it this far... :)"
I love this stuff esp on tap.  Nice carbonation and a good crisp finish.  Perfect balance between bitter and sweet.  Pours pale yellow with a moderate head.  Definitely a keeper
"12 oz. bottle.  Pours clear, golden yellow hew.  Smells strongly of stale hops.  The head appeared for a short period, little over 1 cm. of white head.  Initial flavor is mildly bitter, by the finish it is well balanced by a mild sweetness.  Light body with mild carbonation.  Flavor lingers a bit but is enjoyable.  Something different."
"I had this at the ’Beer Bistro’ restaurant in Toronto on June 21, 2007.  This was poured by the waiter and was a nice crystal golden colour in the glass.  The aroma was yeasty.  The mouthfeel was crisp as was the flavour.  A little carbonation to tickle the tongue always helps.  I would definitely try this beer again."
"drank out of the bottle @ ammirato’s airshow bar in Bremerton therefore the 3/5 on appearance.
very carbinated, slight hop smell, a bit watery.
just an okay beer."
"bottle.  pours light blonde translucent.  Hoppy smell ... stale hop finish and taste.  similar to some german pilsners I have had.  Not terrible but I really question as to the freshness of beers like this, hieneken and becks."
"Great beer.  Flowery aroma with a typical Pils head.  Slighty more golden than other Pils.  Pleasant dry/bitter finish.  A beer for all occasions. 

 Re-rate;  the more I try this the more I like it.  Very well balanced, meaning it is not too sweet.  Actually some hop bite, good flavor.  The good and bad part about the new 6…"
"Draft. I’ve had this on tap many times and have always enjoyed it. Dark yellow body below a frothy, but small, white head. The aroma is mostly malty with hints of grain and breads. There are some notes of hops in the form of flowers. The flavor is moderately sweet, but does end with some hop bitterness. Crisp, comfortable mouthfeel."
"Well balanced, light, pleasantly bitter, enjoyable hoppy aroma, a little sweet. Good Czech pilsner if a little overhyped."
Amazingly good for a mass produced pilsner. Awesome session beer. Light bodied and lightly carbonated with a nicely bitter taste. A little overpriced though.
"pretty much awesome lager, light bodied and highly refreshing and fizzing, still retaining a full taste and palate"
"one of the best pilsners that i have ever had. after all its where the name pilzn comes from. smooth, refreshing and everything inbetween. can drink it all night."
"GRAET PILSNER!!  MODERATE BITTTER ,BUT NO HEADACHE WHATSOEVER! EVEN IF YOU HAVE ONE TOO MANY!"
"Bottle - Light golden color with white head.  Straw, grass, light hops flavor.  Drinkable, crisp.  An average to slight above average Pils.  Goes good with boiled crawfish."
"Dirt cheap in Prague and readily available in .5 L mugs.  The color is a particularly bright gold.  This lager is solid as a rock, marginally preferrable to Stella Artois."
"Re-rate 6/25/07: Sweet up front, crisp and refreshing. Can drink this all day long with a smile. 

A classic pils. This gold standard has a nice slight bitter bite at the finish. Green bottles scare me, but smelled nice and fresh. Nothin like a pils on a hot day."
"Superbly drinkable beer. Goes down as easy as.. well, it goes down easy. Big thumbs up to plzen and Czech Republic!"
Light sweet wheaty aroma. Gold in color with a medium white head. Flavor starts lightly honey sweet followed by a light grassy bitterness and finishing kinda dry and spicy. Light-medium bodied and smooth with crisp carbonation.
"Beer 84 Summer 2006 trip in Europe.  Drank on 7/17/06 @ the Pub/Restaraunt that first poured Pilsner Urquell, the name escapes me as I don’t think I wrote it down, but hell cool place nice to have this at its birthplace."
"Ubiquitous but delicious. Draught at the Carolina Ale House in Durham, NC. Clear dark golden color with two fingers of foamy, cascading, cloud-like white head. Pleasant malty and flowery hop aroma and flavor. The malt flavor is mostly caramel, and is balanced perfectly with the noble hop taste. The only detractor was paper-like note in the finish."
"From the tap it poured a golden color with white that left good lacing.  Has hints of hops, straw, and some sweet malts.  The taste was sweet at first with the malts followed by the hops.  The palate was a little thin, but finished off clean.  Not bad for a pilsener."
12oz - Aroma of sweet malts and grassy hops.  Pours transparent gold with a medium head and good lacing.  Flavor matches aroma but thinner.  Palate is thin and a little sticky.  Non-offensive but pretty boring.
"500 ml can.  Almost as good as the draft version I had at last year’s International Beerfest in Portland,OR.  The prototypical pilsener, an underrated style due to the thousands of lousy imitations out there.  Anyone can make a nice porter or IPA but a pilsner of this quality takes 165 years of practice.  A classic beer especially satisfying on a warm summer day."
"I have finally decided that I can rate this beer as I am now drinking some that is not light struck and skunked, for you see it is in a can. I wish more beers came in cans. Crystal clear straw body topped by a quickly vanishing white head. The aroma is of gobs of saaz. The first sip is marked with some nice round maltiness but then the hops really go into high gear. When fresh and not skunked this stuff is great. Unfortunately it is neither fresh nor unskunked most of the time. A shame really. Go for the cans if you can find them."
"Golden colour,bitter aroma,not the best pilsner.But the first it seems. Hoppy taste on front aga’n after tasted years later. Good Lager."
"In Can 500ml.
Golden color, strong color, with sparkles copper color. A very white, rapid and frothy head. Probably have something of carbonic gas attached. The aroma is slight, floral. In the palate there is a fort hoppy and a well-known malt of caramel. It is a perfect equation. The sweet and bitter finish, simultaneously, invites to continuing drinking. This beer has a great body. I believe that approximately 10 years it was not drinking…"
"Bottle. Pours a light, clear, amber with a large, frothy, white head. The initial aroma is skunk...damned green bottles. Once that subsides, the nose is mostly pale malts and straw. The mouthfeel is light and slick with a light bitter hop finish. The flavor begins with a light, crisp malt front with a mildly hoppy, lightly bitter finish. The aftertaste is slightly sour with a hint of nuttiness. This is a decent thirst-quencher with some character. I’ll have to try the canned version to see how much the flavor was effected by the apparent light damage."
"33 cl bottle. Clear golden color, moderate white head. A good pilsener, with some extra sweetness."
"Bottle-Mahonganey on Walnut, Philadelphia PA. Clear Golden coloring, flavor was slight malt, smooth with a sweet hoppish taste.  Was very enjoyable with a good cigar.  Highly recommended, as a consistent Pilsner."
"Bottle, poured a pale gold with a bubbly white head (that didn’t hang around). A pleasant aroma, some berry fruits and some floral hops. Quite malty in the mouth, a clean palate with an easy hoppy finish. Very drinkable and class above most pilsners."
This is my least favorite style of beer and this one brings out all that I don’t like.Aroma of dirt and corn. Pour was a light gold with a 1 finger white head. Crisp highly carbonated taste of corn and skunk.
"the best beer i have ever had... nice finishing in the mounth, perfect body. light but full aroma. what can i say more? truly recommendable."
"A thoroughly enjoyable beer.  What can I said that hasn’t already been said? Huhhh, well it isn’t pretty in the glass but it does wash down really smoothly, and it awesomely refreshing.  Cheers."
Skunky... really not much more to say about it.  I wish my bottle would have been fresh so I could see what this beer is really all about.
"Everthing you could possibly want from a pilsner;  crispy, saazy, bready, and it gets ya buzzed.  I am so enoyed with people who review this beer after having it in a BOTTLE on one occastion.  This like many euro- beers is the luck of the draw. There’s always that chance of buying a skunked pack. I suggest buying a 12 pack case that’s secured from the light.  Anyway, this beer is the best pilsner because it flys in the face of everyone who thinks lager lacks flavor and complexity.…"
"On tap at the Saucer.  Golden with minimal head.  Soft, buttery aroma with some floral notes.  Taste is bitter with supple maltiness and mild light-struck character.  This one is pretty hit-or-miss for me.  Sometimes it’s good.  At other times the skunk dominates."
Great floral aroma lacking that dominating skunk smell that plagues most pilsners.  Dry/Sweet hops with a little malt in the background.  Get an extra point or two for being a quality beer that is cheap and avaliable everywhere.  prefer czechvar
Yellow-gold in color with a decent head and lace. Some floral hops in the aroma. Taste of the hops and a nice malt flavor. A very well rounded pilsner. Overall one of the better pilsner beers out there.
12 ounce bottle. Straight from the bottle at Canterbury Card Club. Very malty with some hop bitterness and dryness on the finish. Very satisfying.
"Weak head, but an excellent Pilsner taste. Very hoppy and tasteful. Pretty bitter, but that’s only good. Also a plus: it can be bought in a lot of shops outside Czech."
Nice light golden color.  Scent of skunk with light spice.  Taste is skunk as first but then has a sweet almost fruit tinge to it.  Dry mouth finish.  Overal a very good pilsner.
"very weak head, flat beer, strange aroma of spices and heavy aroma of malt(similar to malt liquour), very nice hoppy flavour, bitter but not as bitter as i have expected, dry and syrupy, biscuity,"
"Tap, Bottle. Could try in PRAHA last winter. Nice beer, one of the best pilsner ever. So pour yellow color, with a fluffy white head, the aroma is malty and some sweet, the flavor is refreshing and low some bitterness at fiunish. Great Pilsener beer.

Cerveja clara, com uma espuma densa e saborosa, aroma de malt e sabor…"
"Draft at the Weekend Pub, Newport News. Aroma is lemon and cow shit hay. Color is golden, but not light. No head at all. Flavor is unexpectedly hearty with corn and onion. Wonderful cilantro finish. Even though it’s a Czech product, I think it would go very well with chili or Mexican food."
i guess i expected more of the original pilsner. maybe if i had it on tap rather than bottled but it seemed average to me. sweet and a little bitterhalf way through. carbonation was plentiful. maybe ill get it at the pub next time to give it another try. skunky aroma.
pretty darn good beer. a little pricy for what it is but its a fine pilsner if you ask me.  not my favorite style of beer by any means but very satisfying.
"Draft @ Boatyard Bar & Grille in Annapolis, Md. This beer is a classic. That Pilsner taste is unmistakable....and yummy!  The fact that this beer can be found so readily is nice. A great warm weather beer good for al fresco dining. Although, I didn’t actually have this one al fresco, I was in the fresco."
"A very refreshing beer that goes down easily. Great appearence, satisfying head, generous tast; unique, unto itself.
I enjoyed this, though it is slightly overrated."
One of my favorite session beers.  Finishes clean and has a great flavor.  Good intro Czech beer.
"Clean hop aroma, not so hoppy as American pale ales, but hoppy. Golden amber color with a decent white head. Medium mouthfeel. Instant hit of hop bitter, quickly balanced by malt. And it goes on like that. Bitterness is ever present, and the malt still hangs in at the finish. It’s not a lot of malt, but it’s not a gigantic amount of hop either. Bitter enough to keep around the mouth. Won’t replace a decent ale, but better than 90+% of the filtered golden lagers."
Great amount of hops. Extremly nice. Very pronounced bitterness. Probably one of the very best Pilseners around. Easy drinkable.
"So good that this beer is everywhere Golden colour, thick white head, harsh, characteristic aroma. The flavour is one of its kind, very bitter (epsecially end), some herb-like additional flavour, but not heavy. Serves a great drink to some spicy food. Delicious…"
"Golden with a white head. Grassy nose of hops.  Perfect mouthfeel on the palate, very crisp but not overly carbonated.  Not much in the malt department but a great clean drinking beer with a friendly amount of hops on the finish.  Classic."
"I have gone more than 3.5 years into my beer fandom without ever sampling the classic pilsner, Pilsner Urquell. I ordered it on tap at the Longbranch Saloon and had it served in a tall pilsner glass. The beer looked nice and deep golden, obviously a high quality brew. The nose was semi-sweet and quite grainy. Some spicy hop notes were present as well. The first taste was grassy, sweet, and slightly spicy as well. A nice underlying bitterness hid beneath a malty sweet coat. This is a very good example of a style I am not too fond of. Not bad, but I prefer most other styles. Good to try to…"
"Smooth pilsner with a very bitter taste.  lots of hops help give distinct flavor.  nice, pleasant malty aroma.  i strongly recommend trying it."
"A typical Czech lager and probably the best one at that.  Very smooth, quite hoppy and a sweet end.  I could easily knock back a baker’s dozen of these mothers - it’s no wonder that Czechoslovakians always looked monged out in a backward sort of way, with beers likes this they are probably premanently hammered!"
"Dark gold. Bread and butter. Bread and butter with light, floral, woody bitterness. Creamy palate. Finom!"
"This beer is actually tasty! You don’t have to acquire a taste for mouth-puckering levels of hops. The hop level is just right where ""floral"" can still be found. But malt predominates. It’s so malty it’s even a little like that Mexican pop  ""Malta Goya"".
This beer is just so good it’s not funny.
Of course it’s only 4.4% alcohol as opposed to the average of 5%. How you can solv…"
"Bottle at The Spoke.  Was expecting a lot coming into this beer.  Very strong, bitter aroma and a very hop filled taste.  Little too highly carbonated for my liking.  Poured a golden yellow with a small head.   Average at best, but I’m not a big fan of pilsners."
"(green) bottle. Pours light gold with big white head. The aroma is skunky at first, but when it dissipates a slightly spicy malt and some hay emerge. The flavor is kind of like rye toast, with some grass and hay, and a slight dry apply finish."
"This not too skunky bottle of suds (I hope something was wrong with this batch, I don’t remember it being this skunky) has a better taste than some pilsners but its not very good in this here glass."
"My brother (pojo41) likes this so much I decided I needed to re-rate it.  Poured rich golden color with little head that dissipated quickly.  Not bad, but no overwhelming characteristic that makes it unique in any way.  Low alcohol content like a light beer, but much more flavor.  Better than Amercan Macro-brews, but in my mind not worthy of the additional price.  Slight hint of skunk in the aroma, don’t understand why this isnt packaged in a dark amber bottle to protect from light damage.  I guess the green is traditional.  Overall, pretty good, but nothing special.  Very high on the drinkability…"
The PilsnerUrquell has a transparent and yellow appearance.  Its head is subtle.  The aroma of the beer is mild and a bit hoppy.  Overall it is free of any pungent or defective odors.  The palate of the beer is light but slightly watery.  The PilsnerUrquell has a slightly bitter flavor with a mild finish.  Hints of lemon show through.  The flavors are pretty one-demensional but are light on the tongue.  Overall the PilsnerUrquell is a good light pilsner.
"Bottle at Hotel Pav in Prague. We just arrived, are now having the first beer.
Clear golden - white head. Hay, fresh lemon, citrus, straw. Fresh - better than bottled Urquell in DK....."
"Pours a deep, clear gold with hints of orange and with a thin white head. The head seems short-lived - soon nothing tops the golden liquid, and there is no evidence of lace on the glass. The aroma is bitter and bold with earthy, almost flowery, Saaz hops. There is some lager yeast to the aroma, too. The flavor is quite quenching. Overall, it is firm and well hopped. The bitterness, however, is mellow - typical of all-Saaz Czech pilsners. There are also subtle flavors of crystal malts that lend a subtle balancing sweetness. But the sweetness is hidden. The beer is predominantly dry yet quenchi…"
"500ml bottle. Pours golden with a big frothy white head. Aromas of malt, breadyness, and floral hops. Flavor is grains, malt and hops mostly.Smooth with a nice long bitter finish. A top quality pils."
"Tin.  Tins are a good idea for Pilsener Urquell.  It avoids the skunkiness from green glass Pale golden pour.   Wionderful malty aroma.  Lekker malty flavour with a hoppy bitterness.  Carbonated enough to be refreshing after mowing the lawn.  This is what warm weather beer, after work beer is all about.…"
great beer really good with food or just to relax with like an old hop filled friend.
"12oz bottle.  Pours brilliant clear golden with pure white froth.  Decent lacing.  Aroma is pure hops - spicy, pungent.  Flavor is same yet more intense.  Wonderfully balanced malt/ Saaz hops.  Very well done!"
"12 oz bottle.  There is some promise in this, its better than the typical macro its grouped with its just never fresh, usually light struck, stale .... this one was no different.  Grain and faint hop aroma.  Stale grain flavors some spicy saaz hops.  Maybe its time to drink an actual pint of this stuff."
"Pours golden, with a white head. Aroma is malt, corn, and hops. Flavor is corn, malt, hops, and some fruit. A solid pils."
Green Bottles.  Pours golden with lots of bubbles and quickly disipating white head.  Aroma is bitter stale malt.  Flavor is dry bitter corn and more malt.  Not too much of a aftertaste other than more malt.  Mouthfeel was high carbonation to the point that the bubbles made me feel as if I were drinking champagne at times.  All in all this pilsner isn’t too bad.  I like bitter beers.  I would drink it again as long as someone else is buying.
Bitter nose with a foamy white head. Lasting bubbles through out. Very clean finish with no bitter aftertaste. Not a lot of flavor. So-so.
"I really did not expect to like this one as much as I did as I have not cared for most pilsners that I have had over the years. Sampled from a 12 oz green bottle this beer poured a vibrant golden color with a medium sized white head. The aroma was a nice mix of sour and tangy malts with a hint of fruitiness and a floral hop undertone. The flavor was dry, crisp and had a nice floral hop presence. The finish was tangy and lightly bitter. Nice."
"Ok the first and original pilsener! Pours golden with a decent white head but nothing excessive. Smell is light corn and malt. Taste is crisp, clean, and a bit hoppy. I like this stuff but still think Prima Pils is better."
"simple but good taste with some hoppyness, very refreshing, easy to drink, great pilsner."
"Bottle. Yellow colour with a medium white head. Light floral aroma with hops & malt. Moderate hoppy flavour, medium bitterness."
"This is THE pilsner beer. No other, or almost no other beer should be called that. Great deep golden colour, with orange reflection when you put it to the light. Nice head with lot of bubbles, though it fades quickly, but leaving a great lace. Hoppy aroma of herbs, and hay, with a delicate spicy touch and even some fruity hints. In mouth is round, perfectly clean, bitter, probably the most bitter pilsner I’ve ever had, but with a delicate and silky flavor and smoked notes. Malt is more noticed than in the smell. Dry finish, very refreshing and appetizer. Perfect."
"500 mL can.  Pours a clear golden golour with a fine head.  Aroma is mildly hoppy and floral.  Flavour is clean and moderately bitter.  Leaves a very slight aftertaste that lingers for a bit.  Overall, a refreshing simple pilsner."
Pours a beautiful gold w/medium white head.  Always great looking.  Too bad it is frequently skunked.  But anyway there’s a lot of hop and malt when its not.
Golden with a diminishing head.  Floral aroma.  Dominated by the signature hop with a slight light malty flavor.  Not balanced imo.
"Bottle. Clear golden appearance.  Surprised by how malty this beer was, had coffee, toffee flavors. Didn’t know a pilsner could taste like this."
"Color is clear golden with a small white head that doesn’t last long. A little stronger body than general pilsner, but carbonation is not strong."
"Draft.  Aroma:  Lots of grainy maltiness followed by a healthy dose of spicy/floral hops.  Appearance:  Light golden in color and clear.  White head was full and frothy with decent retention. Fair lacing.  Flavor:  Deep grainy maltiness with a touch of green apples, hops kick in nicely with notes of floral, earth, and spice.  Bitterness is just enough to cleanse the palate.  Nice crisp and clean finish.  Palate:  Medium bodied. Medium carbonation.  Overall:  A world classic, and with good reason.  If you get it fresh and unskunked, this is a very good beer."
"Pilsners aren’t usually my favorite, but the distinctive  hops make for an interesting drink. Nice lemony flavor. I appreciate a nice Pilsner Urquell from time to time, and it’s quickly becoming my go-to everyday beer. If only all large-scale production beer were this good..."
"nice beer. lemony grass, earthy little bit o’ hop bitterness. when you want a pilsner this is one of the two to drink. good body very nice in the spring and summer."
"12 oz bottle from the Bull Run. Could not detect any aroma, the taste was ok with some bitter hops ending. Not bad, nothing great."
I’m not generally a pilsner fan. I prefer pale ale and stouts so I was pleasantly surprised.  Very good beer.  I would buy this again.
"Very nice beer, which was very smooth, with nice bitterness and hop. The hop aroma was present in the aroma as well."
"bottle to schooner glass, nice fruity aroma, nice pale apearance, no head, not much flavour and balanced bitterness, maybe a bit over carbonated"
"Bottle.  Nice and clear with a big head that doesn’t last long.  I’m not a fan of pilsner in general, but I thought that this beer was very good.  I find the after-taste a bit strong for my ale-indulged palate, but I think it tasted great with my heavier flavored burger."
"Pours a medium clear gold with a small white head. A nice looking pour. Aroma had a pretty big skunk at first but that quickly settled down and went away. Light malts, grainy, and a light citrus hop. As it warms a little the malt stands out more.  Overall it was quite refreshing."
"Pours  golden w/ a medium, semi creamy froth that reduces quickly. Residual brewers lace consists of a full canopy. Aroma has a tad skunkiness amidst a briskly malted backdrop. Light nectar w/ ample residual nectar. Malt favors are bright, crisp, and clean w/ a persistant bittering component.  The finish is short w/ a perfect bittering."
"can’t beat the original.  the yeasty hoppy smell is unmistakeable.   on draft in the czech republic, its one of the finest beers in the world.  light beer began here."
"Crystal clear, white head.  Nose is minearl, crispy hops, doughy malt.  Flavor is doughy malt, relatively good hop bite.  Very tingly carbonation.  Slightly sweet finish."
"I’ve had this on tap, from a green 12 oz. bottle, and a .5 litre can.  This IS the original that other pilseners are measured.  Get a good one and you are in heaven.  A skunky one and you wonder what the hype is all about.  Let’s focus on the good.  When good there is nothing better in a pale lager.  The pour reveals a large head that laces down the glass.  The hop aroma screams Saaz as does the bitter flavor.  Then you lick your lips and taste the sweetness of the malt.  A good glass of this doesn’t get much better for a pilsener drinker."
"Dark gold, medium lingering head. Smells skunky, for a pilsner I’d expect more hops. Taste is skunky and light otherwise. Feels like any other lager. I do not like this one at all."
"Very ""hoppy"" with pleasant bitterness.  I’ve read a number of reviews that said it was skunky, but mine wasn’t skunky at all.  Overall an excellent beer that tastes even better when it’s not ice cold."
light yellow with slight cloud.  has some bite for a pilsner and a slight wheat taste at the end.  i generally prefer ales but this is a solid pilsner for sure.
"As a stout man, this beer isnt very satisfying.  Im sure its a good mass produced pilsner, but it’s just not my thing.  Light gold in color with a lot of carbonation.  The smell reminds me of a less skunky heinenken.  Tastes a little better though.  A small bit of hops and some malt make it a little a sweet.  Very easy drinking, but not much depth at all."
Consumed in Prague from a bottle.  This beer is a light golden colored pilsner with a light malty aftertaste with little hop character.  This is a nice example of a mass produced pilsner and would be nice on a hot day but isn’t an overly impressive tasting beer for my tongue.
"Pours golden and clean, with somewhat of a floral aroma. Flavor strikes me as being a bit skunky, but otherwise decent. Overall, I came away somewhat dissapointed with this Pilsener given the fact that it is supposedly one of the originals."
"The orginal Pilsner need I say more,it is excellent,a perfect blend of hops,with a floral nose,very refreshing and effervescencent.The Father of Budweiser ,Coors, Miller and countless others."
"This is quite a fine beer, but its overrated many times according to me. Maby its patriotism or some love to bohemian brews that premakes a certain value of its quality. This beer isnt that good, somewhat a bready flavour but its turning sour and there is an element of what i dont like in beer at all, in it. That flavour of conserved peas kind of fluid. That makes a bad beer to me. Hungover guarantee and some ingredient arent proper in it, lacks bohemian quality."
"Slightly skunky, sweet aroma.  Roasted corn flavor.  Very light taste and mouthfeel.  Sweet with a bitter finish."
"Pours light gold with a quickly disappearing head. Has a mixed malty and hopppy aroma. There is a little skunk in there, but a good malt flavour over top. A little bitter finish, and more mouthfeel than you’d expect from a pilsner."
"(Draught at Soldaten Svejk, Stockholm, 10 Mar 2007) Golden yellow colour with huge, firm, white head. Malty, floral nose with fresh toffee notes, slightly buttery and bready. Malty, clean taste with floral hops, toffee and a hint of malty sweetness. Clean, fresh and perfect pilsner. Very much depending on the way it is served. Go for the draught version, it should take at least 10 minutes to pour and should be served with a firm, rocky head. If so, it’s still one of the best pilseners around."
"Pours with white fluffy head, and a nice clear golden color.  Nice flavor, good finish."
"Nice strong hops.  More hops than grain but this is ok.  Very crisp, bitter, very refreshing.  All around enjoyable.  Its claim that it would make a good measuring stick among pilsners is not without merit: this is nothing outlandish, but it is a very good beer.  I tend to view most beers as being insufficiently bitter--this one is just right.  Warning: this beer does not keep...you’ve got to drink it fresh if you buy it in bottles."
"This is a good beer, but for some reason every time I go to buy a six or twelve pack, I pass on this beer, I’m just not convinced that this is an elite beer."
The quality of this brew has diminished since I first started drinking it. Refreshing but not as assertive as it once was. Page 366 of Michael Jackson’s Great Beer Guide and only 289 of his 500 Classic Brews to go.
"Spicy, pungent hop aroma, Medium gold colour with a fluffy white head that doesn’t last long, and good lacing. Sugary sweetness followed by a lingering bitterness. Clean, crisp palate."
"Certainly one of my favorite pilsners. Sampled many times in bottles and a few times in draft. Aroma is very hoppy and appearance is a little pale, but nice and clear and crisp. Mouthfeel is very smooth with a mild hoppy aftertaste. Flavor is mild and quenches the mouth."
"Had this one on tap.  Pours a crisp yellow with a nice white head.  Smelled hoppy.  Tasted hops and bitterness.  I really like this beer.  Not great, but pretty good."
"very nice pilsner
hoppy aroma
somewhat hoppy flavor
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
"Nice golden color with a small white head, Saaz very preset in the bouquet and flavor, thin mouth feel, Brussels lace all along the glass, the Standard Czech Plz to which others are compared. There are defiantly better, but this is the original. Tough to find in the bottle and not be skunked though so go for the can."
"Strong Flavors of Malt and hops that over powers, filled with its crispness. somewhat sweet, a true definition of what a Pilsner is"
"Reviewed from a 500 ml can.  I refuse to buy this stuff in a bottle - I fear the skunk.  Pours a clear brilliant gold, topped by half an inch of soft foamy white head.  Subtle dry malt and mild spicy hops in the aroma.  Mediocre head retention, slight spotty lace.  Crisp clean taste, light dry cereal grain malt and crisp grassy herbal hop bitterness.  Sweeter malt in the finish, with just a trace of honey.  Body on the shy side of medium, moderate carbonation, excellent balance.  I like this stuff on tap, and now in the can."
"Bottle.Clear gold color.Well hopped,but nicely balanced.Crisp and refreshing.An excellent beer."
Saaz Hops! love that apple and citrus. Malty afertaste. Nothing great to look at. The head is a little weak. Awesome for an accessible macro. Kudos for being the first.
"Bottle. Nice clear golden color, plenty of head. Nice flavor and malty body. Very well balanced."
"Golden/amber in color, disappointing head although this particular beer was poured from a bottle. Small hoppy, citrus, malt aromas. Best thing going for this beer is the flavor. Light bodied, but it is crisp and refreshing with some distinguishable malty flavors. Extra points for being the original."
"draft...This classic pilsener combines classic Saaz hops aroma and flavour with a full malty body. The malt body is distinguishable in the aroma, which sweetens as the beer settles. The off-white head is thick with small bubbles, not soapy like some other pilseners. It has a moderately light body with a fine malt balance, which lingers in the aftertaste. My favourite pilsener,and definitely one of the best macro-brews around."
"Draught, beautiful gold colour, Full body, strong but beautifly balanced. a bench mark pilsener, excellent beer."
"How ironic that this complex, flavorful, well-hopped brew should have inspired so much watery fizz."
"From the tap.  Very good Pilsner style beer that is readily available.  Good traditional pilsner style hops with a nice amber color.  Nice 2 or 3 finger head.  Very good out of the keg, I suggest you try it that way if possible."
Does not have a great appearance but a decent taste.Maybe a little overated. Nice dry flavor.Amber color with a thin head but for a pilsner beer it is a good one.Had it in bottle but from what i was told it is alot better from a keg.
"Truly great beer. Lots of hops balanced with a full, fruity malt body. Lower ratings likely given by those who haven’t tasted this as it should be served in Czech Republic. Bravo"
Pretty good stuff. Light and crisp. Would probably be even better on a hot summer day.
"Pretty nice beer, it poured with a nice head. Pretty smooth after a slightly bitter smell, it was crisp and refreshing even after a few of them."
"Nothing fancy, but I have to say - it’s one fo my favorites.  When I am looking for a pilsner (I drink a lot of them) this is an easy choice because of its availability and overall good taste.  Planning a trip to Prague for my 10th anniversary in 2008 and I can’t wait to try the ’real’ thing."
A potentialy great beer which is almost always skunked by the time it gets to the states. When they learn to use brown bottles they might make more money.  The non-skunky ones I’ve had have a very refined pilsner malt aroma perfectly balanced with fine noble hops.
"Light golden colour, quite large long lasting rocky white head, classic lacing. The aroma has lots of floral hops, good amount of grass and pale malts, lightly sweet. The flavour is hoppy (again with floral and herbal hops), hay, grassy. Good pale malt sweetness. Rather dry mouthfeel, medium/light body, medium/high carbonation. Finishes quite long and lingering with the ever present hop bitterness. I’d give anything to try this fresh on tap in the Czech.…"
"Refreshing and crisp, this is an excellent rendition of a pilsner.  Definitely one of the best macro-brews around."
Undistinguished but easy drinking with light caramel flavors and easy hops throughout.  No trace of fruit.
"Pours clear gold with a foamy white head. Aroma of light hops with skunkiness. Flavor is smooth and refreshing, overall a nice easy drinking pils."
"Musky aroma of wheat and hops. Very clear orangey yellow colour. Thin white crispy head. Bitter but with a texture of honey. Surprisingly smooth, at the same time quite watery also."
"initially slightly bitter, but quite good after that.

I’m rerating this thing. Nice golden color, aroma is lovely and floral, and flavor is loaded with excellent Saaz spiciness. Every time I go to my favorite bar (Bier Stube in Davenport, IA), I get this on tap. It sucks something awful in a bottle…"
"500 ml can - pours clear pale gold, with a small rapidly diminishing white head.  Grassy aroma with some yeastiness and a big Saaz hop nose.  Really great mouthfeel - nicely carbonated, bready, fruity, with a dry/crisp bitter finish.  Wonderful when fresh (important with this style), and one of my regularly stocked summer beers."
"Got this one when a friend came back from Czechoslavakia.  Was not expecting much as he hasn’t tried many beers, but this is certainly a quality pils. Pilsners are not my fave, but it is one of the few beers where having the right bitterness is crucial.  This beer succeeds and offers some subtle tastes of bread and citrus.  Nice aroma too.  I give it a few points extra overall for being the best Pilsner I’v had"
"This a super beer, a real world classic. Has a real spicy aroma  and a bitter finish.
."
Pale gold.  Nose spicy grassiness and tad of skunk.  flavor some biscuit and nice spicy hoppiness.  finishes spicy dry.  definitely the measuring stick of pilsners.
"Chilled 330ml bottle. Biscuity malt on the nose with a touch of spicey floral hops to entice. Full gold body, very clean, decent white head and lace. The biscuity malt base comes through first, followed by some light citrus notes, bit of earthy and floral hops, with a dry assertive bitter finish. Slightly spritzy carbonation, near creamy at times, adds to the thirst quenching quality of this beer. No doubt the benchmark for the style and a good drop to boot."
A really classic pilsner golden colour aroma of hops and a tast of hops crisp and clean with nice finish.
"Clean honey aroma.  Pours light golden blonde.  very clean, honey malts, subtle but crisp hops.  Its refreshing, better than an macro american lager."
"Bottle 0.33L.
Heavy hops aroma (flowers and citrus) with a moderate and nice malty character (grainy).
Clear golden body, with an average, frothy, white head; moltly diminishing with a fair lacing.…"
"Pours a deep golden color with small, foamy white head. Mild skunky aroma. Crisp flavor, nice balance of malts and hops, well carbonated. Creamy mouthfeel, easy drinking beer. Good pilsner."
"bottled poured.  little head and what there was was gone fast.  aroma was a bit skunk but only a mild skunk flavor.  i’m not a huge pils fan and if this is the gold standard, i guess i see why.  entirely average."
"Nothing special. Stronger than your typical pilsener. Tasted a little skunked, and smelled of it as well. Has a clean crisp finish."
"Not much to say here.  This beer poured much like any other pils I’ve tried.  Aside from a mild skunk odor in the aroma, the beer did have a crisp finish to an otherwise bland flavor."
"pretty average beer in a lot of ways.  strong amount of hops compared to many light beers.  Really smooth, so i have no problem with it"
Good beer.  Very clean and pretty crisp.  I base most of the pilsners on this one because I believe it is what euro pilsner should be.  A little skunk but still very smooth.
"I liked this beer.  It had a nice crisp freshness to it with a light crreamy mouthfeel.  The grainy character is almost refreshing when offset by the lagery esters.  This is definately better than most ""lawnmower beers"", and definately serves its purpose as a refreshing session beer."
".5L can.  Poured clean and golden.  Smallish head.  Clean and crisp, if a little boring.  Still, better than most American pale lagers."
"I sampled this from a 12 pack that, so the beer was protected from light, so skunking is not an issue here. The benchmark Pils in my book is Prima, which I had prior to the P.U. It has been sometime since I lasted had a P.U., so I was not sure what to expect. This Czech beer has little to no character. The nose was nonexistent, no hops to found, and the malt was covered up by diacetyl It was a totally mess of a beer. Really, I would of rather had a PBR than this swill."
"Like the description says all other pilsners are a better or worse attempt to copy the original. Actually as far as pilsners go i think this is a bit better than average, has a cleaner taste than most but also has that hoppy aftertaste of a pilsner. All in a not a bad beer but not a good beer."
12oz bottle-A golden body with no head and has an aroma of skunk and an American Pale Lager. Taste of mild hops with a dry finish. Not bad but not my cup of beer.
"Bottle Golden clear colour with a nice big long lasting white head. Bit fruity hoppy aroma. Flavour is refreshing, crispy and hoppy, some sweet maltiness. Dry hoppy average aftertaste. Great pilsener!"
"Bottled. No head from the pour, very yellow in color. This has a better taste than other yellow beers. Sort of skunky. It would not be my first choice, but better than mass produced american bunk."
Pours golden with very little head.  Aroma is hoppy and floral.  Flavor is slightly nutty but hop dominated though they are not strong.  Finish is dry and pleasant.
I used to drag these one home from Prague back when Tuborg and other mainstream pilsner like beer was all we knew about. Still enjoy the taste!...and the memories
"This is my stand by beer. If you’re in a pub and all they have on tap is major brands, and the fridge is full of Bud and alcopops, its an Urquell for me. More hops and malt than most other common largers, bit more oomph. It has that skunky quality. It does have a slightly chemical after taste. Not a classic, but I like it."
"bottle.  clear golden pour with almost no head.  nice carbonation.  aroma of wheat, grain, hops and lemon.  Body much the same.  nice clean and crisp pils"
"Disclaimer:  Mine was very skunky so i will need to get it from a better source next itme.

This was worse then heinekin.  How do they pass this off as a real beer in so called classy restauraunts.   I wish these eating places put effort into beer like they do wine."
This is an OK beer. It has that European type of hops and malt in the flavor with a hint of toast in the aftertaste. The aroma has latex hops and corn flakes. The real disappointment was the head. I was expecting it to be Euro lager so not much else to tell.
"I found it to be a very crisp pilsner.  Easy to drink and quite enjoyable.  I heard good things about this beer, and I’m not disapointed by it.  Although it was a bit expensive."
"I was really looking forward to this pils and was a little let down.  Smell is OK for a pils and the taste reflects the same.  Not bad, but not good.  Clean, crisp but nothing note-worthy there.  Little bit hops, little bit of flavor, ok.  Not much else to say."
"Bottle. Nice aroma. Very Sweet smelling. Very small head which didn’t last very long. Taste a bit skunky, but could definitely taste the hops and grain. Aftertaste was a bit skunky as well."
"Pours a clear, pale amber with little quickly dissipating head and little to no carbonation.  Very clean and sweet to the nose.  The flavor was most impressive:  Sweet mustard, hops and corn bread with a bright crisp aftertaste.  Palate is light yet the richness of the malts are present.  All these characteristics are what I have come to expect from a great pilsner."
"Gold with little, very little head.  Aromas of hops and malt.  Crisp and clean on the palate, the flavor is also somewhat rich for a pilsner.  Taste is of hops, malt, and grain.  A little bitter with no alcohol taste.  Also, Pilsner Urquell is a little heavier than most pilsners."
Nice little blond beer that go down easily. Gold color with very little head that dont last too long. I could see myself drink a couple of this one in a party.
"Definitely a fresh only beer. I’ve really grown an appreciation for this beer. It’s dangerously drinkable and has enough there to keep me interested. Golden bronze with a large pillowy white head. Aroma is grassy hops and sea air, bread, flowers. The mouthfeel is buttery, but the hops dance on the tongue. Dangerously drinkable, probably my favorite pilsner."
This was the beer that got me loving Pilsners and away from the dometic beer I was drinking.  A great tasting enjoyable beer!
"Bottle Not too bad, probably  best pils I’ve had. Crisp palate, not my style, but not too bad."
"Tap at The Drake in Chicago.  Honestly, I really wanted to like this one.  But, there just seemed to be something off about it.  A bit skunky in the nose and again in the mouth.  I’d have expected that from a bottle, but not when it’s on tap, especially where there are only 4 beers on tap.  Once I got past the initial skunk, it wasn’t too bad.  Somewhat crisp and refreshing.  Not too complex, but it is what it is."
"This is the way a pilsner should taste.  Not perfect, but the standard to which other pilsners are judged.  Tried it for the first time about 20 years ago and still find it great to this dayt."
"Golden colour. Slight head quickly clearing no lacing. 
Lovely malt driven aroma, slightly bready.
Very low hop aroma, slightly disappointing - expected more saaz. Possibly a little travel weary."
"ahh the original pilsner.... golden colour small head as said before slighly skunky nose with citrus, sharp flavour slightly bland, a downer"
"Bottle. Pours a light golden color with a small fizzy white head. Aroma of skunk, grass and citrus. Taste is bitter and sharp. Terrible I thought. Three sip and the drain pour."
"Maybe the best product SABMiller makes (or owns).  Light golden color with light pils malt aroma.  Smooth taste and a nice finish.  Good overall beer that is very drinkable.  Nice brew, but could be more like a Victory Prima Pils!"
"Considered a classic, but that must be in the fresh and unprosessed state. Rather ordinary pilsner, but with a far better bitterness than the average light lager. Hops are lacking in the nose, but it has a good malty/bready profile throughout the beer. Dry and bitter finish."
"I think this is an extremely over rated beer. Way too hoppy and bitter. It reminds me of Heineken, another nasty tasting beer. There are a couple of beers that people in America buy just to say they are drinking imported beer. This is one of those beers."
"Great tasting pilsner!  The first of its kind.  Smooth and biting it’s very refreshing.  My only criticism is its price and quality here in the US, I visited the Czech Republic this summer and the bottled stuff here just isn’t as good as the tap."
"Green bottle when opened smells something like wheat beer, slightly yeasty.  Lots of bubbles in the glass but has an almost flat palate.  Has a hoppy bite and was not as clean tasting as I anticipated. Lingering bitter finish.  Typical pale yellow american beer? I was a little let down on this one.  There are many pale yellow american beers that are better than this.If this is the original style pilsner, appaerently pilsner is meant to have a bitterness about it.  Will not buy again. Nova Paka is better too."
"Just about one of the best beers you can get anywhere. Pours a nice golden color with a lingering head. Crisp, clean and aromatic aroma invites the drinker to open one after another. Saaz hops are well defined and evident in its aroma leaving a nice bitter aftertaste beckoning you to one more bottle. If only they sold it fresh on tap in the States I wouldn’t have to save up for a trip to The Czech Rep."
"One of my favorite beers, love the flavor which is stronger than you would assume but it is not overpowering.  A fine import."
Clear golden color with a small to average head. Aroma is nothing unusual. The taste is extremely good for a pale beer. Strong yet extremely smooth. Most lighter beers with this much taste sacrifice balance or bitterness. Claim to be the original Golden Beer.
Clear golden with a very small head. Aroma is standard pilsner. The flavor is on the other hand much better than standard. More hoppy and a bit sweeter. It also has a very smooth feel to it.
"an excellent drop that MUST be servered COLD.
A beer that hits all the senses in prefect harmony.
I you generally like continential lagers I suggest you try this refined pilsner.
did I mention must be cold?"
"This is my favorite of all time... My dream is to get to the brewery sometime in my life... and taste the ""old"" stuff. 20 years ago in Chicago we could get the cloudy stuff for $2.50 a bottle in the stores... now $12.00 for a 12 pack - but that cloudy bit of heaven has beeen filtered out... but it’s still the best reagardless. Hoppy?, yes! but full, complex in the mouth and a great finish. At the same time - it’s not heavy at all - very refreshing  - great with food."
Bottle. Golden colour with a white head. Aroma and flavour of malt and hops with a bitter finish.
"This is the beer I would like to drink in heaven. It is wonderful, with a long aftertaste, with lovely bitter hopiness. 

My favourite beer. Magic stuff."
"Golden colour with a very small diminishing white head. Full and great aroma of crisp saaz hops and malts (aroma diminishes as head disappeares though). Flavor of sweet malts first, then bitterness. Quite bitter for hops, but still very refreshing and easy to drink. Medium to light body; decent palate. Nice malty and hoppy finish although it turns a little metallic at the very end. Very good lager."
"Hmm... old beer. Another great Czech macro beer that is just as good if not better than the smaller Czech beers. It is also no wonder that Czechs drink so much beer when this is available everywhere. The beer is a little skunky and musky from the beginning, but the taste is the best green bottle taste a beer could give. Really nice and smooth pilsner. A little bit bitter, but still refreshing and easy to drink. Well balanced and certainly there is no need to change the recipe. Hear hear for beer!"
"Nice, deep gold color, and a white head that I was hoping would have stayed around longer. Aroma reminds me of hay. Initially, a slight malt flavor, and then quickly changes to a moderately aggressive bitter flavor. Finishes on a pleasant, grassy note."
"What a refreshing brew, and its after taste is quite nice too, Good taste with a nice crisp bite, good aroma, great appearance too, I really want to try this on tap now!...opa sure does like it!"
I had this in the Czech Republic a few years ago.  I don’t remember too many details other than it was an all-around good beer.  If only the larger brews in the US could be this good...
"[Floras kaffebar with the Roots]

One of the favorites. Nice sharp bitterness is THE note of this wonderful beer. Thanks to the year of 1842!"
Rich complex malt and spicy all Saaz saaz. Slight diacetyl and DMS fro Pils malt round bitterness. Medium carbonation and mouthfeel. Low carbonatye water makes for a nice well rounded beer
"bottle, pours a golden straw color with a thin white head.  nice crisp hop aroma, unfortunetly along with a little skunk, damn green bottles!  nice flavor, clean, crisp with a little sweetness and mild hop bitterness.  bubbley mouthfeel and a nice finish.  would love to have it fresh in the czech republic."
Bottle. This beer always pours with a nice creamy head and a rich golden color. I like pilsners and this is the original. May be one of the reasons Czechs drink more beer per capita than anyone else in the world.
I wasnt a huge fan of this brew.  Came off somewhat skunky.  I was somewhat in a daze when drinking it so I think it deserves another tasting.
"Bottle.  Poured golden, nice white head.  Solid flavor, nice body.  Pils are supposed to be refreshing, and this one certainly is."
"Nice golden color. Slightly bitter taste, but still very nice to drink. nice pilsner."
The one that set the standard.  Fizzy head yielding decent lace.  Little body but a bunch of hops with a little malt.
"Not a big pilsner fan , but this one has to be the best. 661ml bottle drank out of a pilnser glass. Has much more body and aroma than your average miller product , great lacing on the glass, great color. I may go grab one these again soon."
"Excellent for what it is, a pilsner.  Light yellow/golden color and typical pilsner aroma.  As a general beer it’s good, but boring.  Still sometimes you just want a light regular beer and this does the job."
"The grandfather of all Pilsners.  Bottle - strong malty aroma.  Clear yellow color with small collapsing head.  Highly carbonated with moderate malt and strong hops finish - good smooth flavor with the right mix of hops. A best bet in the Czech Republic - spectacular!  Also have had this in the States - there it is hit or miss as this beer will get skunky if it sits too long - if you’re in an area where a six pack that costs more than $5 is a waste - I would be wary about buying it but if it’s fresh, it’s a great beer."
"Light in colour-light yellow to be exact! Head poured thick, but was gone in a flash. Smells of fruit and herbs. Taste is as you would expect. It’s a pilsner, thus not very interesting, but it goes down smooth. Decent light beer."
"Poured a pgolden with a little bit of head that quickly disappeared. Aroma of Miller Lite. Solid flavor. Not quite GBP, but then again what is."
"A golden bodied beer with a white head.  Nothing extraordinary about this beer, rather a typical pilsner."
Had this beer with brutalbitter.  Not all that impressed.   clear yellow in color.  malt aroma and thats about it.  I got to keep the glass though!!!
bottle.  I should have known better.  This was a single bottle I purchased that was sitting under fluorescent lights.  completely skunked.
"Draught in Plzen. It’s got all the elements - nice and refreshing, good balance of hops/malt/bitterness etc. Pretty variable on tap... can be quite ordinary. Surprisingly though, one that I think pretty highly of as a bottled choice in Oz."
"Gold color , clear – decent  white head –nose is soft, semi-floral, grassy , cereal, hopps , and malts , very clean  - taste of  sour / bitter , grassy , rice flavor , hops , and malts – dry bitter mouth feel – skunky  , cereal , bitter and grass aftertaste"
bottle. yellow color. large carpy head. corny aroma. acidy corn taste. thin and slightly bitter.
"Forget the whole ""its the original"" nonsense and just enjoy it for what it is. A fresh refreshing beer, with a clean taste and satisfying feel. There are better .....but then there are worse...alot worse!!"
"On tap in a shonky looking pub in Prague. Pours clear golden with a creamy white head. Spicy flowery aroma, very very fresh.  The carbonation is remarkably soft compared to the bottled version. The flavour is a magnificent balance of some sweet grainy malts and a solid spicy hop flavour... Floral hops also come through. The finish is so crisp and satisfying. One of the best pilseners, and certainly a different experience on tap in the Czech Republic."
"One of my go to beers. Extremely refreshing. Very light, with tasty hop flavors. Easy quaffer. It can’t get high ratings because it’s not complex; still, it’s a good beer."
"How can onenot appreciate the first pilsner crafted on the planet Earth?! It pairs well with creamed beef dishes, or brats on the grill over cooking wood. It also stands alone- a clear, crisp, mouth-filling delicious brew.  To those of jaded taste, return and begin anew with this one."
"bottled 0.5l, typical pilsner look and feel, golden color, quickly diappearing head, hoppy. not bad, but there are better"
"Draught.  Pale yellow with moderate head.  Aroma is mild and of the expected Saaz hops with a bit of sweetness.  Flavor is a bit stronger than expected, initially sweet and finishing somewhat hoppy.  I’m not a big fan of pilseners in general, but this is pretty good."
"500 mL can.  Poured yellow-gold with a tiny bit of head that disappeared immeiately.  Mild aroma, slightly sweet.  It’s got that pilsener taste (corn?) I don’t like.  (Why do I keep trying these things?)  A little sweet.  Not much finish."
"Pours a clear gold, with small fizzy white head.  Standard beer aroma with some hops.  Slightly floral flavor, skunky, a little malt, and hops.  Watery and tastes like any standard pils.  Not very good, although I did enjoy this as a refreshing beer with some good food."
660ml bottle. Pours light amber with a very poor/ non-existent head. Nothing much to say in the taste department - watery.
"I must say that I had high hopes for the father of the pilsner berr, and was sadly dissapointed.  Yet to have found a pils that I like, this is another that falls into the ""brews I probably won’t ever try again"" category.  Looks like a pils, smells like a pils, tastes like a pils.  Very corny/tomatoe-y flavored, almost like tortilla chips with salsa.  Overall, a little below average, a dissapointment."
"Bottle. This is the genuine pilsner, but time seems to have changed (better pilsners/lagers have emerged). Golden yellow with white mostly diminishing head. Aroma has light malt, some flowers and a little note of yeast. Flavor has nothing more than a distinct hoppy and somewhat watery taste. Average duration of dry finish."
"660 ml. bottle.  Classic skunk aroma.  But the taste is well balanced.  Much like Heineken, but better; understandable why this is an original classic."
Wonderful gold with steady rising bubbles to a nothing sort of head.  Malty aromas and moderate saaz bitterness.  Medium body.  Benchmark pils eh?  Fair enough.
"I know this is the native pils, but why in the hell do they put it in green bottles without a f-ing date!  I’ve had better, but I KNOW that this is best fresh.  I’ve had this on tap where it just screams at you.  I’ve had it in the bottle when it is a disgusting mess (skunk, stale and ketchy).  This is why import beer is such a roll of the dice.  InBev, for all its knocking against localism, atleast has some great standards (expiration dates, filaments, off-site testing, warm-climate moderators, etc.)  These czechs need to get with it.  I’ve had too many disappointing $7 / sixers from this brewery."
"Bottle. Poured a clearish yellow with a good sized foamy head. Scents of hops, heavy malt character, some ""old cellar"" notes. Taste is pretty malty however there’s some skunky hops in there that come out on top. Finish is not pleasant, tasting of moldy hop."
"12 oz bottle.  Pale yellow, active carb, fluffy white head.  Sour lemon nose with a hint of Pine-Sol and skunk.  Bready, bitter bite with what I can only describe as sour coconut milk.  Sort of light; carb fades quickly.  Clean finish with school paste."
Cold 12oz bottle:  Clear golden orange color with barely any bubbles.  Aroma is of mild flowers and citrus.  Fizzy on the tongue.  Taste is moderately bitter with some sweet notes to it.  Finishes well.
"Re-rate 8/29/06:  Clear pale yellow orange with a thin white head, aroma contains flowers, grass and some citrus, medium bodied with nice carbonation, starts and lightly bitter.  Re-rate 3/29/02: Crisp and refreshing.  Getting a new, unopened 12-pack is the way to go with this beer.  Be wary of a bottle sitting under the lights.  First rating:  It is a quality pilsner, however that in itself is a big problem for a stout/barleywine drinker like me."
A very nice yellow pils with a thick white foam. Malt and citrus flavors with a long bitter aftertaste. A typical pils !
"Bottle: Not a fan of Pils, but this perhaps better than average.  Has a sweet taste to it that I found to be a little weird.  It was smooth though."
"12oz bottle-pours a foamy white head with yellow color.  Aroma is citrus-lime, grain.  Taste is citrus-lime-, grain, funky, grass, slight hops-flat/bitterness at finish.  Light body, mild carbonation."
"very good pilsener, dry and clean but with a good deal of bitterness, a good finishing aftertaste. Good stuff"
"This beer hasn’t been on shelves in New Zealand long but sadly is slipping into the Eurotrash category which houses Stella Artois, Heineken and Carlsberg. Such a pity for something that was the original. In saying that though, there is no reason why knocking off a dozen bottles should have to be a chore. This beer is dry, refreshing and leaves you feeling satisfied that you’ve purchased just the right thing to have with your camambert while you’re watching the cricket."
"Draft cold. Sublte hop notes no skunk to speak of becuase of the lack of a green bottle.  Nice very straight forward taste, just a touch of sweet hay, and moderate hops, quite nice, very easliy quaffable and sipable, a quality not often found in beers. Quite nice if more pilsners tasted this way I would drink them."
"Golden color, wunderfull head  I’f bin in the factory 15 years ago, and keping lots of good memory of this beer.
Good one with nice grassy smell and taste."
"Bottle, Over-carbonation, flavor has a hint of skunk, stereotypical euro-beer that has been outclassed for a long time."
"At my friends house,bottle. I just can’t get past that nasty skunky smell and taste of this European brews. It makes me cringe just thinking about that beer.
It literally smells like a skunk."
"Can.  Poured a beautiful golden color with a small head that quickly disappeared.  No skunk smell that I have gotten from bottles.  Amazing mouthfeel from a 4.4% beer.  Maltiness that clings to the tongue, which is then quickly replaced by a dry bitterness from the hops.  Finishes crisp and clean.  The gold standard for it’s style"
"Bottle.  Yellowish.  Hoppy aromas.  Not sure if this is what I expected.  This should get reconized as being the first of it’s kind, but many many beers have surpassed it since."
"500 ml can: Pours a nice gold colour with a slight white head. Aroma of wheat, hops, and some malts. Tastes wet on the palate and finishes with a slight barley/wheaty aftertaste. The original Pilsner is indeed a fine beer."
"Way better than a typical lager. Hoppy flavour and very refrshing, although I dont think its as great as some make it out to be."
"This is one of my absolute favourites. Also my first rating.

Light golden colour, smooth flavor and aroma with lots of hops. Palate is easy and nice, nothing special. Especially tasty with a good steak!"
"A golden pour with a crisp white head that dissipates quickly.  The aroma is rather dull--a little hops is all.  The taste is clean and refreshing.  Good hop flavor in this one.  A great ""crossover"" beer for newbies."
"Golden body with thin white head.  Smells like not much, but the yeast and hops are present for sure.  Tastes almost nothing like I thought.  Kind of sweet and malty, but not all that strong.  A nice little beer though.  I’d definitely have it again, but I probably wouldn’t crave it or seek it out."
"Gold with a fizzy head diminishing quickly.  Initial skunky aroma gave way to hoppiness and straight-up grain with a bit of grass or hay.  Flavor was lemony hops right up front becoming  tangy/sweet grain malt with a bitter hop finish.  Palate was a little watery, but overall a dependable Czech pils."
Good flavor and poor appearance (too cloudy).  Like the flavor much better than the typcial american beers.
"An excellent brew. A beer as smooth as they come. Leaves a nice lace on the inside of the glass; rich hoppy flavour. I’ve only had this beer out of the can, but I’d love to try it on draught."
"When in Omaha, drop into the Bohemian Cafe and drink this on tap out of large heavy ceramic mugs made by Frankoma. Then enjoy some liver dumpling soup. I guess my point is that the classics are going to always be classic and stand the test of time. Please, make sure that you get a light-protected version of this (such as on tap). You beeraphernalia collectors can also buy the Frankoma Bohemian Cafe mugs as a souvenir."
"This is one of my mainstream favorites, enjoyed recently on London trip in Chelsea, but have also drank in Praha. Very refreshing and not too strong. Clean."
Not my style of beer and I found it painfully mediocre.  The little flavor that was there was truly pilsner and therefore too skunky for me.
Bottle. Golden. Malty and grassy aroma. A lot of malt sweetness balanced by nice hop bitterness.  Too sweet for top scores.
"Bottle.  Clear golden color.  Aroma is light and flowery.  Taste is as you would expect.  It’s a pilsner, thus not very interesting, but it goes down smooth.  Decent light beer."
"Excellent on draught in the Czech Republic.  Considerable hops and fairly bitter; lots of carbonation.  Easy drinking, crisp and one of the more refreshing beers around."
"For years, I’ve heard that this is the world’s best pilsener but the one I’m drinking now isn’t. It’s a little skunky. I know that it is not the beers fault but if we get them that way, C’est la vie! After first taste the hops seem to overwhelm the malt till near the end when it sems to even out. Excellent malt flavor throughout with a palate that seems to say, ""Yeah, I’m a light beer, but not a pansy! Rerate on 7/24/06 This beer is much improved when gotten somewhat fresh. The  combo of noble hops and toasted malt is heaven to the nose. The combo is evident in the taste also as this is no beer to be…"
Light crisp and tart like a grapefruit. Has a grassy or barley aftertaste. .
"One summer, I went to Prague. Before this, I had heard of P-U, but it wasn’t everywhere. I toured the P-U Brewery. Right after MillerSAB bought them. I came back to the states. There were Pilzner-Urquell ads on everything. The moral to the story? Don’t let the big brew co. put you off. This isn’t a bad pull, it can get a little too bitter is left out too long, but it’s pretty easy drinking and light."
"Golden-orange in color; nice dense head. Unusually full-bodied for the style. Excellent crisp hop finish balanced by the maltiness.  The best pilsner I’ve ever had, and I’ve tried many."
"One of my taste-off beers for Czech style Pislners. Lucky enough to first drink this in Czech Republic. Never tastes as good out of country & need to check best before’s. This sample was quite fresh, a three months old. I like the big bitterness, though it has limited drinkability & a couple would be enough.   Nice golden colour and crystal clear. Nice hoppy aroma."
"This is among the strongest smelling beers I have encountered. Amazing in appearance, it looks perfect in the glass with it’s small white head which quickly fades. Great summer time beer. It smells really strong though.The taste is a bitter citrus grapefruit with a fresh cut grass aftertaste. Flavors are very thin and watery yet the refreshing buttery crisp it has makes this beer drinkable,"
"Golden with thin white head.  Aroma is hoppy and grassy.  Mouthfeel is very thin.  Flavor starts of grassy, moves to bitter with a hint of citrus.  Too watery and too weak to be excellent, but not bad by any stretch of the imagination"
"12oz bottle, no date.  Pours a clear golden with a small, quickly dissipating white head.  Aroma of grain, grass, and spicy hops.  Fair amount of bitterness, quite taste as well.  A little corn and grain in there with some malty sweetness.  Light-medium bodied, lots of carbonation.  As a pilsener it’s pretty darn good, and I agree it sets the standard.  I believe the lower ratings are people who just don’t like pilseners in general."
"Brought a few bottles of this home in my suitcase.  Poured a clear light yellow with a small head.  Excellent mouthfeel.  Nose is mild hops.    Good to the last drop.  There are better pils around, but there is nothing wrong with this one."
"I’m not really a pils type of guy, but this is one of the better bigger ones. Golden colour, white head, good amount of hops for the style, quite refreshing. Yes, it’s good."
"Pours a golden to copper color with a shiny white head. Aroma is very hoppy, saazy. Taste is really balanced between the evident hoppines and a godd, bready malt backbone.

Nice pilsner indeed."
"On tap.  Wow, what a disapointment.  Watery with a thin head.  Smells of some malt with a little hoppy character.  Clean taste, but not that interesting.  Beer has come a long way since 1842, and I’m glad."
"Light yellow liquid with a small fast fading white head.The smell of hops is very evident.The taste is crisp,clean with a stong hop flavor.A nice beer if you like this style."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a pale yellow with minimal head. I’m not much of a pilsner fan to begin with, and this didn’t work hard to change my mind. I’ll put this in the same category as other light bodied beers. Not a lot of taste and other qualities we normally rate, but oklay for having a couple cold beers by the pool on a hot summer day."
"Can 500 ml. I just don’t get Czech pilsener, I know the story, but I just don’t think they taste good, at all. Especially not Urqell, which is supposed to be the mothership of them all. The nose is skunky, metallic and reminds me of shoddy Swedish beer in general (Spendrups anyone?). Taste is not much better, thin and soapy. Tasting this parallell to an India ale and the ale has such an appetizing hop bitterness compared to Urqell. I’m wondering what the Saaz-hops is all about? Still, I’m going to give this guy a couple of more tries... just not in the near future."
pours clear golden with a small white head. aroma mostly light skunky saaz hops with a slight malt presence. lovely bitter saaz hop flavor shines through but is balanced out by just a hint of malt. light body. dry bitter hoppy finish lingers for quite some time. great refreshing summer beer. fantastic hop profile.
"On tap, Mild hop aroma, golden blonde color, clean dry crisp mild bitter flavor, light to medium body. Refreshing hop finish."
"A nice pilsener. One of the best of the kind. Golden colour. Aroma of grass and malt. 
Good bitterness."
"500ml can from LCBO. Clear golden colour, pours a medium white head that disapear quickly. Aroma is grassy and sweet. Taste is well balanced, bitterness is present with  maltiness, sweet flavours and a grassy aftertaste. Good Pilsner."
"skunky smell, good taste, but strong bitter aftertaste, overall ok beer, probably want buy again."
"Not much aroma, not much taste.  If any of either I picked up on almost a tea flavor.  I could see how some might say a soapy aftertaste.  Fair amount of carbonation - not much head - clear and sparkling - yellowy golden.  Overall, an easy beer to drink.  Might be a decent idea if you are going to have a few.  Not a bad beer at all - just nothing breathtaking.  Everybody is rating it with a skunky aroma - I did not pick up on this."
"Poured a clear golden color with a nice initial head and plenty of carbonation that provided a steady stream of bubbles rising to the top. The aroma was typical for the style, grassy hops with a touch of green botte skunk upon opening (very light though). Flavor was surprisingly impressive (for the style), unless I just don’t like this style enough to fairly rate anything within it. In any event, the malt base was present and full with grassy hops to bitter things just right. No skunk at all in the flavor. Mouthfeel was fairly light and drinkable, although full for the style. Decent beer, maybe I got a lucky…"
"Smells slightly skunky with mild hop aromas.     Mild bitterness, clean light body.  Slightly soapy finish with bitterness lingering."
A fine pilsener beer.  Pours a golden colour with a little white head.  Smells slightly hoppy and tastes smooth with a little hoppiness.
"This had a small head.nice amber color.aroma was weak.taste was slightly bitter.Hops,corn.not bad.I might but again."
"About what I expected from friends’ testimonies.  Definately had the import taste, which isn’t bad.  I don’t believe there was any skunking (thankfully) from my bottle and it is quite an enjoyable pilsner.  I’ll go with the rest; change from the green bottle...but that is almost a trademark of this brew.  Recommended."

"Even after Oakes told us not to try Pilsner Urquell, I went out and purchased a 6 pack.  Truth is, this is a representative of a pilsner style and is easily accessible at most liquor stores.  The green bottle is not ideal for the beer, as it can taste a bit skunked.  However, as long as the beer isn’t overskunked, I am okay with it.  This has a nice sour tinge with corn and hoppy profile.  A good representative, maybe slightly under Victory Prima Pils and Schell Pilsner.  However, if I am ever overseas, I’d be curious to see how this tastes fresh out of the tap."
Golden and crystal clear color with tiny ring of white foam. Aroma is skunky yeast followed by a tasty malt smell. Flavor is sour yeast and then a mild malt backbone with some bittering hops bringing up the rear of the taste profile. Aftertaste is a bit sour. A really refreshing beer for a hot summer day.
The best example of Bohemian Pilsener. Quite good. Only wish they would switch to brown bottles. Too easy to get skunked with the green.
"Skunky aroma, like a Budwieser. Not uncommon, because they’re both pilsner. Apperance is amber with white head. Palate a bit boring. In fact, I don’t see why this is such a popular beer anyways."
"A little skunky.  ""Rich man’s Heineken"" perhaps? Finish is slightly bitter, easy drinking though."
"(Bottle BB 10/01/07) Hoppy and malty aroma. Golden colour, slightly sparkling and small, more or less fully diminishing white head. Bitter, malty, fruity and slightly butter-like flavour. Softly carbonated, slightly sticky and medium bodied palate. More bitter than ""Budejovicky Budvar"". This is one of the best pilseners I’ve tasted! 27/05/06"
"Bottle - Had a little skunk to the bottle, like most green bottles.  Bought from a local convenience store so I think it might have been aged.  Would like to try it again on tap."
"Golden colored pour with little to no head.  Aroma was hoppy with a little skunkiness.  Had a crisp hoppy, a tad bitter finish."
"What can I say, in general Czech beers are good, in fact from most of my ratings I realise I tend to select them for drinking. This beer has a great taste, quite strong actually for a light beer. Goes down smooth."
"Golden beer with a short lived white head.  Clean hoppy aroma. Good malt flavor on the front, but too bitter on the end. Good body with some crispness. Fairly good for a pilsener.  I am no fan of pilseners.  Wouldnt have bought it except the bottle shop had it on sale and I been seeing it everywhere lately.    Czechvar is better.  ..  5-09-2006 ..  on tap at the Jacksonville Ale House.  Smooth and lightly hoppy goodness.  Crisp and tasty."
"Fantastic example and worthy benchmark for all pilsners.  Malty, mildly bitter, golden and crisp.  Tastes clean and refreshing.  Bold, too."
"Quite possibly, along with Stella Artois, one of my favorite lager/pils out there. It never fails to deliver the goods. Aroma is grassy hops, clean and fresh. Mouthfeel is always lively and crisp. Flavor is also crisp and clean, fresh and hoppy, malty and grainy. I’ve never gotten a bad bottle of this, and it’s even better off the tap. Glad to have bought a bottle of this to review, because it’s been over a year since I’ve had it. Good stuff."
"Rich and deep gold in colour, Laces nicely. Aroma drags you in across the room. The triple decoction makes the difference and the flavour is a superb balance of malty sweetness and crisp hoppiness. I would sell someones child for one right now. Not my child but... you know..."
"slight skuny aroma.  Light golden color with little head.  Slight skunky taste of corn, grass and hops. Not the best tasting pilsner I’ve tasted."
"Pours golden smells the way beir should smell white head diminishes to globs in lace that last the duration. Has that hops taste, moderate carbonation that feels good in the mouth not pins and needles. The first time I had this brew was 50 kilometers out of Plzen Czech at the recommendation of an Austrian acquaintance  that highly recommended this beer, and I was not disappointed  and was glad to find it extremely available ."
"I like this beer. It is golden in appearance, has a thick white head, clean taste and is far better than miller lite."
"i nice pilsener and an awesome experience. drank this beer throughout prague, in my opinion not quite as good as the budweiser budvar but definately worth a trip to the brewery in Plzen."
"I LOVE THIS BEER! One of 2 of my long time favorite beers. I just get POed finding it poorly handled and light struck (you call this skunky?). I’ve been drinking Urquell since it was exported with cork/foil lined crown caps and you only got 3 or 4 bottles out of a dozen that weren’t air damaged. Easy to tell though, with the “shingles"" this left in the bottle base. Shake it once...that’s your test. Better bottling technology since then but importers still aren’t too particular about temperature or light or date. That is why I prefer this beer on tap  when they get it in. Buying it in stores is still a dice roll unless…"
"Not to impressed. smelled funky and tasted funky, may have been an old bottle. aroma and taste of grass, corn and some other not to nice flavors. watery to. it probably wasn’t a good idea to drink this after i drank alot of stouts and triples at the beer trade show. not impressed."
"(0.5L Can) Pours yellow with ordinary white head. Well balanced flavor overall, with a sweet aroma. A pretty good Pils."
"Bottle, 660ml. A yellow colour pour with a large diminishing head. A nice hoppy aroma. Taste of hops with a bitter hop finish with an occasional hint of grass or citrus. Light to moderate carbonation. Not much more to say really - it’s a Bohemian Pilsener and that’s what it tastes like."
"""Poured a golden color with carbonated head. Aroma was grassy hops little snunk to it Flavor was typical for pils grassy hops, bitter aftertaste. It wasn’t bad for a pils."""
The Original Pilsner is still the Ultimate Pilsner. Well balanced in flavor and with a relativly rich aroma. Me likey!
330ml bottle. Golden coloured. Short lived head. Light floral aroma. Medium bodied. Some hints of hops and malt. More than an average product of its style. Refreshing and a fine partner to fish.
"Bottle sampled with Stegosaurus. Poured golden with a thick long lasting white head, aroma of skunkiness, malt, and yeast, the taste is bitter, and malty, not bad just wasnt impressed."
"Nice golden appearance, crisp taste, soothing aftertaste all the way through the bottle"
"Bottle  Pours a crystal clear golden with a good white fizzy head.  The head lasts fairly well and laces decently.  Has an aroma which reminds me of my fathers beer when I was a kid.  Has a good floral hoppiness , but I still think of my dad’s Schaffer.  Has a light body with a thin texture.  Has a decent bitter kick with a slightly metalic finish.  A fairly good duration and an alright aftertaste.  This really is a decent beer.  Not as bold as many craft beers but on pace with many upscale macros."
"Good solid beer without doing anything spectacular.  Very drinkable, but also quite forgetable."
"Pours golden with white head.  Aroma of floral hops with a hint of sourness.     Malt is nicely balanced with grassy hops and finishes dry.  Not spectacular but solid, good summer beverage."
"Bottled. Light-carbonation golden beer with a small white head leaving lacings. Quite weak aroma with flowery hops overpowering the malts. Clean, malty and hoppy flavor, with a lovely bitter finish. A bit thin body, but ok. (060411)"
Bottle: Light golden with a nice head. Very good pilsner for this stout drinker.
"Light bronze, a nice floral aroma based on a good amount of hops in the brew, making a good combo with the malts and crystals. Finishes oily, salty and bitter. Medium carbonation and a regular apperance."
"330ml bottle.  The classic Pilsner from the country where the Pilsner is as much a tradition as persecuting gypsies and beating them up with clubs and rocks.  Clear golden-yellow body with a small white head.  Floral hoppy nose.  For some reason I never had a Pilsner Urquell that had the typical green bottle problems (skunky aroma, premature aging, etc.).  Light to medium body.   Grassy mouthfeel with a very well balanced taste between the malts and the hops.  Long mildly bitter and grassy finish.  Leaves an overall salty and dry feeling.  It’s not often that a best-selling beer is…"
"It’s my first Czech beer and I was not disappointed. For sure, thats not the best beer ever brewed, but still a pleassure to drink."
"Draght.
Clear golden coloured with a small white head.
Aroma of malts and hops.
Flavour of fruits, malts and hops.…"
Aroma of light malt and bananas.  Pours a medium bronzy color with a nearly white head that dissipates quickly.  The taste is fresh with a bit of that fresh banana malt flavor. The finish is quick and clean: the beer is fairly dry but as per style it isn’t going to have a bunch of lingering hops.  I imagine that this would be better on a hot summer day.…
Got a giant 710 ml  can of this in windsor and was anxious to try it but slightly dissapointed. Not a bad flavor but too much of a skunk flavor/smell to be enjoyable for me
Poured a golden yellow with a nice white head.  Classic pilsner taste with a smooth body and moderate to medium hoppiness.  Maltiness is also present and hints of floral tones.  Overall it was smooth and I’d like another.
not bad clean crisp nice carbonation pours nice head golden color a little bitter on the aftertaste.
"Medium dark gold color, medium head. Hoppy and malty. Nice floral hop flavor, good balance, only slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is full and round. Taste is smooth and full bodied. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Bottle. Clear and golden with large frothy white head. Slightly hoppy aroma, very clean and refreshing taste nice bite to it, with a good dose of bitterness."
"This beer poured out a golden color with a nice white head.This beer has a full malt flavor ,but a kind of skunky smell to it,but over all a pretty good beer."
"A full malt flavour which is complemented with fruit from the hops and a proper bitter sting in the tail. Soft, but still with the unmistakeable character. A yardstick indeed!"
Pale gold with a decent white head. Hop and malt aroma with a malty flavor thats leaves a nice bitterness in the aftertaste.
"Wow. Although it had a faint skunky scent, Pilsner Urquell had a fruity and hoppy taste, and a refreshing if astringent finish to it. Recommended."
Bottled. Golden colour with a white head.Fruity aroma. Weak bitter and malty flavour. weak bitter finish.
"Bottle. Not a huge fan of pilsners; however, this one is very solid for a macro. Fairly hoppy for a pils, with a hint of lemon grass and a fragrance some people believe smells like burning weed. Leaves a rather unpleasant aftertaste."
"Bottled version poured into Pilsener Urquell glass. Skunky smell hits me as soon as I open the bottle. It’s hard to get past the skunkiness but there are hints of lemon and grass in the background along with an odd soapy smell. Funky light-struck flavor. Flavor isn’t too offensive but it’s not too complex . Beyond the aforementioned skunkiness, there is a decent amount of hops but I’m once again hit with a strange soapy flavor. I feel like I’ve missed out on this beer. I’ve never had a particularly fresh sample on draft or in a bottle and while I taste potential, I’ve never been very…"
Flowery and very hoppy aroma. Fairly average pilsner looks. Very hoppy taste with a very long aftertaste. Very delicious and very drinkable.
This is a very light pilsener brewed in the Czech Republic. Has a strong hoppy taste and a malty aftertaste. I recomend the unfiltered more.
Golden color.  Not too much description to add for the numerous other ratings.  Mostly light slightly nutty and bread.  Mild hops.  I actually do enjoy this.
My favorite beer for many years.  Glad the iron curtain came down as now you can find this everywhere.
"Had a bottle of this laying around for a while. Had to be at least a year, heck up to 3 or 4 years old. Don’t really know, friend of mine left this at my place.  Pours a translucent golden orange with a very small white head that went away quickly.  Aroma of grass, hay, light citrus and a sweet maltiness.  Flavors of the same. Dry and crisp like a Pilsener should be."
"500mL can from the Beer Store.  Pours to a medium gold, thin white head that dissappated rather quickly.  Aroma is of malt and wonderful floral hops.  Taste is of slightly sweet malt, and again, floral hops.  Not the most complex, but a good beer nonetheless."
"Pours a deep golden color with a small and quick head. Aroma is very hoppy, wih floral notes and some tree leaves. Fine attacking mouthfeel. Flavor shows a full hoppy bitterness, strong for a Czech Pilsener with a very sour and citric end. Not my cup of tea."
On tap.  Pours golden with a good size foamy white head.  Plenty of hop bitterness with little malt to balance things out.  Finishes crisp...but there is something about the aftertaste that I don’t dig.  Alright.
"On Tap.  Golden yellow coloring with a thin, slightly uneven, lumpy head.  Nice light aroma of freshly squeezed lemon and a touch of cut grass.  Flavor is crisp with the just the right amount of herbal hoppy tones.  Smack of slightly bitter dandelion leaf at the end.  Clean finish.  Overall, a well-balanced refreshingly hoppy pilsner."
The aroma was a bit on the skunky side.  Poured dark yellow with a fizzy white head.  Very refreshing taste.
"bottled. very very good light beer, with great fruity flavour. a little bit bitter taste, harmonic and great :-):-)"
"On tap: great refreshing pilsener, nice strong white head, some herbal notes, some spicy notes, sharp dry bitterness from the hops, medium body, one of the better pilseners out there."
"The second time around this is not as bad as I remember.  Maybe all of the other Pilsners I have had have been skunky and stale.  This one is still pretty unexciting, watery, and smells like dirt.  Maybe some spices too.  OK spicy dirt.  Medium bodied."
A golden brown beer with quite a strong white head. A discreet hoppy aroma with a wheaty finish. the taste is of dry hops and a slightly sweet finish of malt.
"Reach deep in the shelf for this one.  Light struck Urquell is awful.  But get a good one, and you’re in pilsener heaven.  A fantastic summer (or winter) session beer, and a benchmark of the style.  Beautiful zesty hoppy bite and flavor, with a solid light to medium clean malt backbone."
"I am not sure if my bottle was light-struck, but the hop aroma I had heard so much about was quite skunky.  Medium-bodied and malty, almost too much too be refreshing.  I did not enjoy this one at all."
"If you can get this beer fresh, without it having been light-struck, it is a delicious and beautiful thing.  Slight notes of sulfur on the nose -- but a big malty aroma accented by spicy saaz hops comes thorugh as well.  A wonderfully brilliant clear gold.  Malty.  Hoppy (in only the way saaz can be hoppy).  An almost perfect palate.  Get it fresh.  Get it on draft if you can’t get it fresh."
"The measuring stick for a pilsner.  Refreshing and light compared to what I usually drink which is a good thing sometimes.  Grassy nose, pale color, white head, crisp finish.  What else can be said about one of the most famous beers in the world?"
"I’m very much new to the pilsener style.  I poured this out, and it was a transparent golden color, with minimal, quickly-disappearing head.  The smell was slightly floral, very pleasant, slightly skunky.  I took a swig and was very impressed.  Lots of carbonation, prickly on the tongue, good hops flavor.  It had a slightly bitter finish and little aftertaste.  I’m used to drinking heavy stouts or Belgian Whites, and it is refreshing to have a simple beer like this once in a while.  This was an excellent, yet simple beer.  I would not hesitate to buy this again, and I think it would be great to…"
"Tasted as part of an ""outhouse"" pilsener/lager tasting we had to clean our our fridges. This one held up very well, certainly one of the top pilseners we had that evening."
"This is the Pilsner that I’ll measure other pilsners.  This is the best pilsner and one of my top 5 beers.  This is easy for me to find fresh and on tap.  Golden body, average white disipating head, smell of saaz hops, grassy, and lemony.   The taste is wonderful, kinda bitter, not too sweet.  Great balance. Finishes very dry. Pour me another!"
Bottle- It’s nice that you can find this almost everywhere. It is really hoppy compared to several other pilsners that I’ve had and finishes really bitter.
"Green bottle poured a clear gold with a minimal white head. Aromas of some skunk, sweet malt and and some floral hops. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of bread, a bit of carmel, some earthy hops with a pleasent bitter finish."
"Bottle-It was hard to get past that smell.  It was a bit like rotting logs.  The beer had a small, quick lasting foamy head that reduce to nothing.  The color was darker than pilsner.  The taste was more to my liking with malty taste and a hoppy bitter finish."
White head. Unclear yello0w body. Malt aroma with long bitter hops aftertaste.
"Pours a goldy orange.  Very strong aroma, very pilsenery.  A very nice weight to it, not too light or watery, but not too heavy.  Would complement a meal very nicely. Crisp and clean.  Ridiculously easy to drink, probably the ideal session beer.  Complex enough to enjoy by itself, but light enough to drink with a meal and complement rather than dominate.  Quite a fantastic beer."
"Nice overall scent when pouring into a glass.  Fruity, sweet smell with a hint of bitter.  Head very foamy, but dissipates enough to drink within a minute.  The carbonation continues throughout the entire drinking process.  Slightly bitter taste at first, but becomes more watery throughout the drink.  Reminds me of a Budweiser with a stronger scent, and  slightly bitter.  If I had a choice of beers to serve, I would choose this one over Budweiser, but the decision was close.  Overall, I would call this a Bud of the Czech."
"Draft.  I suppose I expected more, but it seemed pretty run of the mill.  I assume it has been altered for import?  Slightly skunky, mild hop taste, goes well with dinner but I can’t imagine drinking it by itself just for the flavor."
"A real treat after work.  Nice blooming head like soft ice cream over the rim of the glass.  Beautiful golden color.  Nose only makes me salivate in anticipation of the Saaz hops.  So nice going down, but towards the end of my glass, after the beer had warmed substantially, the finish had some funky sewerish note.  Could be my imagination.  One of my old favourites.  Love those hops.  Always a really great experience."
"Very light, beautiful clear golden color. Not much in terms of aroma or aftertaste, but is quite refreshing."
In prague for two weeks and drank pilsner out of 16 oz cans and loved every last drop
"Had this on draught at Falling Rock, Denver. Beer poured a crystal-clear,  medium, warm, yellow color with a small, creamy, white, mosly and quickly diminishing head. The aroma was moderately malty with toasted grain; heavily yeasty with sweet notes of bread dough and cellar. The flavor was lightly sweet and moderately bitter with an average-length, heavily bitter with a sweet, milk-like finish and pretty honey retros. The body was medium-to-full, the texture was watery and the carbonation was lively. This has been the nicest sample of the style I’ve had this far."
12oz bottle- Nice sweet syrupy mouthfeel with a dry finish. A great deal of flavor for a pilsner. This beer is very drinkable and has a the hint of a sweet bread flavor. The beer pours a honey like color with little head and little lacing. Solid beer for the pilsner style.
"Can, 500 ml; appearance: good head that vanishes quickly, yellow with some orangey reflection; nose: hops that is dominant giving an impression of freshness; mouth: hops dominate, followed by some bitterness and sweetness at the end"
"Better than most, pours nicely with a quick minute head, golden yellow.  Well received pilsener."
"Re-rate from the elegant green bottle: Skunky first whiff but then the nose settles down into just hoppiness.  Rich golden pour and a fizzy little white head.  Really does set the bar for the style - thick, dragging body and lots of oily, hoppy bitterness.  I take it over Bud. [3.3]…"
"Ok, so now that I""m going through the list, I have had this one a few thousand times, so why not rate it. Pours out a clear yellow color wiht a decent head. Aroma smacks of Saaz hops and it should as they claim to be the first Pilsner. Taste is somewhat bitter, little skunky on the taste, I’d like to try a really fresh bottle of this to be a true judge of it, but the local store isn’t that good as far as freshness goes. This has become somewhat of an old stand by and not a bad one...warm weather beer though."
"Bottled. It’s pale and grassy, a little gassy, not a hog but nor too classy."
"The bottle is way better then draft.  Had this in draft format and I was not a fan.  Not that I am that big a fan of the bottled version, but it is much better.  Highly hopped beer with the expected skunky taste but it was not bad.  Slightly bitter."
"12 oz. Bottle.  Body is a pale golden yellow (although more vibrant than the mass-market American beers) with a 1 inch, quickly dissipating white head.  Aroma smells somewhat skunky to me.  Taste is better - hops with some citrus, although some of the skunkiness is still there.  Palate is crisp and clean.  I’m not much of a pilsener fan, but this is better than many."
"Very good, for a pilsener, for my taste. I like dark beers, but this one is good, refreshing and with character."
"Above average beer.  Perfectly golden color, 1 inch white head forms but dissapates within seconds.  Not much smell to be had, lightly hoppy. Has a crisp taste with slight bitter taste of hops."
"Bottle.  Straw gold, almost no head, a few sparkly bubbles rising.  Smells slightly of corny can aluminum.  Tastes mostly of syrupy corn, maybe honey if being generous.  Drinkable but not desirable, for me.  Not lightstruck at all, just too sweet and frankly, corn syrup tasting."
"After drinking this, you’ll wonder how Miller Lite calls itself a pilsner.  Golden color; pleasent, but not overpower scent.  Crisp taste, a little citrusy.  Just a great beer."
"From a 12 oz. distinctive green bottle with a coded freshness on the back label. Made a decent appearance, poured a pilsener golden with a nice foamy white head and a minimal amount of sticking. Had a spicy grassy aroma, with traces of citrus and a mellow graininess. Good carbonation and a smooth, crisp light medium bodied mouth feel, good drinkability. Taste at first was a grassy hop bitter, a little spiciness, followed by a biscuity maltiness and a dry, crisp finish."
"Bottle. Golden yellow, white head, very pleasing aroma. strong bite, very metallic aftertaste, i love this beer."
"Pilsner Urquell pours to a beautiful bright, brilliant golden color with a thick, creamy white head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is very fragrant with flowery/herbal hop aromas coming from the classic Czech hop variety, Saaz. The palate on this beer is soft, with lots of good crisp pilsner malt flavors, and just a touch of diacetal, which makes the mouth feel slightly buttery. The body is so round and clean on this beer, making it so, so drinkable. Pilnser Urquell finishes with more of that good malt flavor up front, then ends with a dry, grassy, balancing hop…"
"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass...well...this is just a beautiful beer. Golden ""beer"" color with a short, steady head that is constantly refreshed by the continuous stream of fizzy bubbles rising through the brew. The aromatic, floral saaz hops eagerly great the nose and give a hint of the flavor to come. Fizzy goodness on the tongue with a great balance of malt, hops, carbonation or is it carbonation, malt and then hops. The balance is there and satisfies my love of good beer. I can definitely call this my favorite pilsner and also one of my favorite beers."
"Pale golden body under rapidly subsiding head of coarse white lace. Faint aroma of malt and crisp hops. Clean malty taste with hints of straw; clean crisp bitter hop finish. A very well-made pilsner, though not that exciting. Certainly not the best pilsner I’ve had."
"Been many years since I’ve sampled one so shared a draught with my wife while out to dinner last night. Medium clear golden color under a thick and durable bone white head. Aroma is dominated by the utilization of Saaz hops which is PU’s trademark; pleasantly grassy and lemony. Palate was a bit on the thin and fizzy side. Taste seemed too grainy (adjuncts?) with a medicinally bitter hop contribution. Finish was refreshing and clean, but quick"
"12 oz bottle: poured a light gold color with a slighty yellow head.  Slight smell of hops, wasn’t too excited to try after smelling.  Taste was slightly bitter but not enough for my liking.  Not my favorite pilsner"
"12 oz. bottle:

Poured, it foams to a huge, semi-dense slightly yellow head that subsided to about an inch in 1 minute, leaving small bits of lacing. Aroma is mostly Saaz hops with their grassy smell, with just a trace of citrus. Extremely clear straw colored with a few…"
"12oz Botttle:  Pours a golden straw color with a thin fluffy head.  The aroma is of grass, hops.  The taste is pilsner.  A full flavored, good pilsner."
"Beautiful golden color.  Nice aroma and an even better taste.  The floral hops certainly come through.  I had been looking forward to trying this one and I wasn’t disappointed.  I really enjoyed this pilsener and wished I’d had more than one bottle at the time.

Re-rate:  Now having tried it on tap, I love it even more.  At least for right now, it’s w…"
"Very nice Bohemian Pilsner, no doubts here, but I must admit that I had expected a little more than what it offered to me. I would rather prefer something like Staropramen, Kozel or Budvar, but that’s each one’s preferences. Anyway world class beer!"
Bottle.  Poured light gold/yellow.  The head which was a nice white one dissipeared so quickly I was not looking forward to the first sip.  Smells of hops are faintly there.  Ok bitterness and some wheat flavor is prevelent.  The score is much too high in my opinion.  This beer was mediocre.  Its like a full-flavored bud light.  I’d rather have a Stella Artois to be honest.
Old reliable. Wonderful bitterness. Clean and refreshing. Good beer to start out with as you work yourself through a flight.
Pours a clear yellow with a diminishing white head. Sweet and malty with grapefruity bitter hops aromas. Medium bodied. Funny with a rare pilsenr experience... Not my prefered style. Nice and very basic beer.
Bottle.  A big resounding meh.  It’s a nice golden pour with white head.  Tastes like a pilsner.  The first one I had was skunked but the rest were okay.  Very easy to drink but nothing overly special.
"One of the most important and best beers in the world. soft water, bitter hops, clean finish. This is the one."
"A true classic, intense hop flavor.  Great color, nice pour.  Very enjoyable."
"Pours gold-yellow with a two-finger white head. Light malts and sharp earthy hops in the aroma. Pleasant flavor, with a light hop finish. Very drinkable, of course."
"My brother in laws favorite, being the Worlds First Pilsner and all. I find it to dry and a little bitter. It does have a clean taste to it, surprisingly how the hops finishes bitter."
"one of the worst beers i have tried, one sip and i got bitter beer face! i would probably never drink one again..."
"From a bottle.  This beer has a hoppy aroma and a nice golden appearance with very little head.  This is a crisp beer with a slightly bitter, dry finish.  There is a very subtle sourness that surprised me.  Overall a good drink, but not a great drink."
"The problem in rating this beer is that I’ve had so many over the years. It’s quality is very dependant upon freshness. At it’s best, it’s just about without equal as far as Pilsener’s go. I’ve had it on draft in Mittenwald, and even it’s color was different than the bottled variety. That’s the one I’m rating here. Just the right malty palate perfectly balanced with the floral aroma and flavor of Saaz hops. Clean, dry, and slightly bitter finish. A perfect Pilsener. On the other hand , I’ve had it bottled, obviously well past it’s prime, and I wouldn’t rate it more than 2.5. Now I’ll only buy it in stores that I perceiv…"
One of the first beers that I have fallen in love with. Great hoppy malt flavour with a dry bitterness at the end of a gulp that leaves your mouth crisp and clean. A very subtle but very real sweetness after taste that leaves you loving and wanting more of this wonderful stuff. I might be new to this beer rating stuff but I knows what I like...I love this beer!!
"Pours a deep golden yellow with a small white head that lingers.  Aroma of fresh hops and some malts.  Crisp flavor that follows aroma, with a clean finish."
"Clear golden colour, carbonation, average white head, fresh aroma of hops, some malts. Crispy taste, smouth finish, one of the beter pilseners"
"Bottle into a glass.  Pours pale golden, standard pilsener, not to my mouth, it finishes too bitter to recommend."
"Draft at Dakota Grill and Spirits.  Good to know what a Pilsener is supposed to taste like.  Nothing real exciting, but then again it’s a pisener.  It wasn’t difficult to drink.  Decent aromas, and a pleasing flavor."
"I love this beer!  I drink a lot of NW beers, and often forget about imported beers like this.  I don’t know why.

Served out of a bottle at a local restaurant.  Pours big white creamy head (looks like snow).  Aroma is beautiful!  Saaz pouring out of the glass.  Crisp typical lager smell.…"
"Bottle. Golden colour with white head - quickly gone. Hoppy aroma. The flavour has a nice hoppy bitterness, but is also metallic and a bit soapy."
"Fizzy, yellow, a little skunky, lemony. Pretty clean taste, completely dry, not seeing much saaz goin on... This beer is nothing short of overwhelmingly mediocre."
"Pours with good sized head, wonderful aroma, slight bitterness. the skunk that some people mention wasn’t in this bottle. But i’ll usually drink this one from the tap."
"Poured from bottle into hourglass lager glass.  From the sulferous aroma, this bottle has clearly been lightstruck.  The flavor wasn’t quite as skunky, but still not up to the clean standard that I’ve heard about with this one.  Had a light body with a sharp hoppy finish.  I will rate this one again either on draft or from a can (if it even comes in cans) so I can avoid the damn green bottles."
"Pours a crisp clear golden yellow color with a fizzy white head.  Aromasof hops, grass, and grains.  Flavor is a nice crisp hoppy/grain taste with a nice clean finish."
"On tap, in Prague.  Crystal gold color with small white head.  Clean fresh taste.  The standard for all Pilsners.  Excellent."
Had this on tap. Clean mildly fruity aroma. Gold in color. Small white head that was mostly lasting. Clarity was somewhat hazy. More hop note to this beer than what I expected. Has a dry refreshing palate. I liked this pilsener.
"Bottle: This world-class brew belongs to the small number of victims of the ""velvet revolution 1989""!  Still extremely good, but in the dark age of communism - believe it or not - this Pilsener was better and the best way to forget the daily frustration.....
Dark golden colour, thick, creamy head;  good balance between the dominant beautiful hop aromas (herbal, floral, grassy) , caused by first class Saaz hops, on one side and a smooth, malty body on the other side. Compare it to a watery german (or dutch or…"
"Had this many times, from bottle and tap, and never really could find myself liking it. Looks the part on most occasions, a crystal clear pale gold with lots of bubbles. Smells of light grass and some light Saaz hops, very crisp. taste is not so crisp. Usually I get a funky metallic or rubber taste that I will not attribute to the lines or storage conditions, as it is always there. Somewhat malty, somewhat bitter, with some Saaz. Drink it cold and fast, otherwise it may be a drain pour."
"Good aroma, taste like a malty lagar.  Medium body with a green bottle taste.  Some hops. Not use to the style."
"Never rated this out of a bottle because it always seems ""off"".  Out of a tap, this is such great stuff!  Malty and savory with an impressive hop presence.  Very satisfying."
"Ok pilsner - but not ""exiting"" enough in my humble opinion. A little hop and bitterness but to anonymous for me."
Clearamber appearance.  Clean drink with hoppy finish.  The carbonation complements the the astrigencey of the hops in perfect harmony
"No, its not the best Pilsner in the world (see Lakefront), but its better than I remembered.  Yes, the aroma may be a bit skunky, but there’s some honest pilsner floweriness too.  Very drinkable, with a less astringent aftertaste than many of style."
"On tap at Robb’s Ribbs in Albuquerque, NM - Quite small white head with a light-yellow body. Not much aroma... Dry and bitter, but refreshing. No Skunk in this glass! Went well with my ribs and other BBQ / sides. Cheers!"
"Refreshing, bitter, tastes great from the bottle or the tap. Tastes best cold, and is dry with a bitter, hoppy aftertaste. Low ABV makes it even nicer."
this is a pretty refreshing beer.  A bit skunky.  not thin like many other pilsners i’ve had.  would be good for a hot summer day.
"My favorite ""green bottle"" beer. I kind of like the skunkyness and would almost be afriad to try it fresh.  Hoppy and dry....makes me pee like an untrained german shepard."
"Sampled on tap at MillerTime in Milwaukee.  I found this brew to be decent, but probably a bit out of date.  Almost skunky.  Saaz hops were noted.  Give me a Victory Prima Pils anyday.  I’d like to try a fresher version of this on tap.  It did get better as it warmed up."
"Bottle
  Pours nice and gold with a subdued head.  Aroma is nice and pungent, with notes of hops and malt.  Flavor is a refreshing blend of the aforementioned ingredients.  Crisp, tangy, and bitter.  A good pilsner."
"very light and refreshing look, but looks can be deceiving.  starts fine and then goes downhill from there.  

maybe i had a bad bottle but i thought it was funk, smelled of skunk.  may have to try this one again because i don’t remember it being offensive in the past.…"
"An excellent light beer.  From the home of pilsners (Pils, Czech Republic), is yet another example of the master breweres from Eastern Europe.  Clear, light, refreshing"
Can. Pours clear yellow with a small vanishing head. Good ol saaz. I’d like to try this beer on tap where it is made.
"Bottle, golden color, minimal head and lacing, strong aroma of skunk and tastes skunky as well.  I’m not big on the whole green bottle style of skunky beers."
"(500ml can) Strong aroma, very pilsenery. Golden-orange in color. A sweet malty accent. Nice  white head which diminishes rather quickly. Very little lacing. A fair amount of bitterness.  Nice, gentle, lasting bitter finish. Good carbonation. Slight hoppy aftertaste. I like the balance of this beer."
I did not enjoy this beer.  It had an aftertaste that did not agree with me.  A bit skunky for my taste.
"Nice beer.  Crisp, light. It’s a pilsner, so if you like pilsner, you’ll probably like this.  Maybe a little skunky, but all in all a good bet.  No strong leaning one way or the other with regard to rating criteria.  Good session beer."
"Nice sweet/ hay aroma.  Beautiful golden color with constant carbonation.  Mouthfeel was much smoother than expected. Kept waiting for a bad or metallic aftertaste like other bad lagers I’ve had, but this finished nicely.  Haven’t had a lot of experience with good pilsners. Very pleasent to drink though."
"Overrated.

Skunky.  Rich beer with some Mass Producto qualities, I am not a big fan of skunkies."
"The 1 pt., 6.3 fl. oz. bottle yields a crystal clear, pale gold bodied beer with a large, tight white head with good lacing.  Hops and light, sweet malt dominate the aroma, although there is a bit of hay in the nose as well.  The sweet palate entry is complemented by a nicely hopped, long, dry finish.  There is a limited flavor palate, mostly light malt with a hint of butterscotch.  This is a very good, mass-produced beer."
"66cl bottle, very fresh from the bottle on Charles Bridge at night, summer in Prague.  Almost sweet but not really, almost bitter but perfectly balanced. My notebook remarks on the large bouquet of floral hoppiness this beer can possess, a very ""dimensional"" quality this beer lacks when it travels. Unforgettable. From ideal barley hops & water was born a true original.Later footnote ""..the same recipe dating from 1842."" -? Bah, SABMiller has been brewing this with pelletized hops for at least 5 years, and also far away from the ""Original Source"" of water in Plzen, Czechia. These boastful SAB…"
"The look: I love the look of the bottle, the beer is an amber color, pretty regular.  The pour: little head, unusual for a pilsner given the high yeast content in brewing the beer. The smell: one thing about pilsners, they can smell skunky, you have to get them fresh.  Taste: good at first, although bitterness in the back of the tongue that lingers(I like a little bit  cleaner of a finish).  Over all, its pretty average, I think the name and reputation make people think this is a better beer than it is."
Very nice and tastefull beer when you think about it is a mass produced beer. Compared with other pilsners from e.g. Carlsberg this Urquell is much better
"Not really one of my favorite choices, I feel it comesn on very, weak. I feel like I am driinking water, with only slighlty more flavor. COuld just be me, i have tried it a few times, on tap, in the bottle, this doesnt do it for me."
"Tick head, a lot of carbonation, kinda watery but and a little bit too hoppy.   I had head that this beer was kinda good for the style, but I took one of these and I didn’t really enjoy it, so I took another one to give it another chance, wasn’t really better."
500ml can. Nice golden colour. very little head or lacing but I really enjoyed the taste. Would go out of my way to find this beer again.
"It has that pilsner bite and the lovely gold color, certainly defines the style but I don’t usually choose it.  I drank this a lot in Germany where it tasted somehow better than it does here."
"Pretty good Pilsner, although I think it can’t hold a candle to Jever...my favorite."
"Bottle. Well, it seems to me that many of the pilsner and pale lagers I’ve tried so far have very similar flavors. Variations on the same thing. That being said, this is probably the best of the limited few I’ve tried. Nice golden straw color, with big white head. Lightly citrusy and malty aroma. Flavor was also very malty, but pretty tasty and light. Body is just north of watery, but in this case that isn’t a bad thing. Refreshing beer. If this was cheap, it would be a pretty tempting thirst quencher. Still pretty tasty for what it is, though I’ll take my dark beers any day."
This was a nice looking beer.  Then I sampled it.  Incredibly bitter!  Was ready for the glass to be empty.  Just goes to prove you can’t judge a book by its cover.  Disappointing.
Pours golden with mild whitish head.  Nose has underlying skunkyness.  May have been an old bottle.  Flavor is light malt and strawlike.  Finishes with slight and i mean slight hop bitterness.  I would rather have a few of these than a BUD anyday.
"Certainly a decent pils, with a god hoppy character. Not the most exciting, but I’ve had a lot, lot, worse and this one is very drinkable."
"Big bottle.  Pours a  rich gold with a moderate head, that bugs out pretty quick.  I really hate rating pale lager type beers because they all taste very similar to me. Malty flavor, some hops.  Not bad."
This Czech Republic pilsner is claimed to bring you in touch with the roots of authentic pilsner. Expect a crisp yet bitter taste with a delightful hop flavoring.
THIS is what a true Pilsner is supposed to taste like. I only wish American beer companies could make their beer taste like this.
"i see a lot of hype about this beer right now. not very different from heineken or becks, imho, yet heineken is bashed and becks is tolerated. go figure."
"Smelled so skunky I almost didn’t want to drink it, but the taste isn’t bad. It’s got a good crisp dry bite from the saaz hops, it’s like a sweet, flavorful heineken. Had this on tap recently, and wow it’s great. Taste is very spicy with a pleasant aroma."
"Even among pilsners (not my favorite) this wasn’t all that great.  I must have different taste buds than some of these other folks.  No offense to them, pilsners aren’t my specialty, but I was far from impressed. Tasted skunky every time I tried it.  2/3/3/3/12…"
"Man thats good lager. My sister brought me some back from prague along with a Tshirt which i wear with pride. Yet to find it in a bar though i’ve found somewhere to buy it. Good crisp taste. Good colour, good head, good taste, gimme another..."
"Pilsner Urquell... Decent aroma, nice to look at, and very flavorful.  The down side to this is that it’s not a very complex beer, and the head is practically non existent.  The flavor is good, just totally 2 dimensional.  Very drinkable, though.  Great for a hot day.  Not too fizzy either, just the right amount of bubbly for a pilsner."
"They say it’s the most typical of its kind, and I tend to agree.  Any drawbacks have more to do with this type of beer than its individual characteristics."
"Cannette-Délicat arôme houblonné, goût fruité, très bonne pilsener.-Can-Sweet hoppy aroma, fruity taste, very good pilsener."
"33 cl Bottle. No yeast in bottom. Light golden colour with a nice head. Hints of flower in the nose, from the hops. At the flavour first malty then absolutely a lot of hoppy taste, that ends up clean and tasteful. A really great pilsner. But this beer taste best when it is youngest. The hoppieness disappear and the only thing that is left is maltness."
"Bottle, poured gold with big white head, which disapated before i could even take my first sip. aroma was slightly of a skunk although i don’t know if that is what its suposed to smell like. Also detected some flowery smells. Taste was much better than the aroma sweet with a slightly bitter aftertaste. The taste is well rounded and makes you want to have annother sip. After one bottle i want annother."
Poured a clear golden color witha medium white head.  Malty aroma with light floral notes hovering around.  More malt for the flavor.  Somewhat sweet with a mild bitterness on the finish.
"A very good classic Pilsner. The original. Was better in Czech Republic, but still good here. And it is now easyto find. I solid beer anytime, anywhere."
Those Bohemians know their beer.  Nicely carbonated.  Tastes great with food. Slightly bitter.  Wish I was in Czechosloaki drinking one on a patio.
"Can (500ml).  THIS is that incredible beer everyone yammers on about?  Although to be fair the praise usually comes from people who are exclusively pale lager drinkers - ""it’s so smooth!"".  Popped the can can it sounded more like tomato juice than beer - no carbonation, nada.  Poured deep gold with a hint of red; I blinked, there might have been a head.  Smells faintly of rye, corn, wine cooler, skunk juice and sugar.  Taste isn’t too bad, if you like metal and wood - woody malt and incredibly harsh metallic bitterness that just builds and builds.  Kinda oily mouthfeel.  Maybe this one doesn’t…"
"I really like this beer. It has a strong aftertaste, but it tastes very good. It might smell a little funny to some people."
The skunky smell was hard to get past. No that I have tried the beer for the taste it has become one of my favorites. Nice pilsner with a hoppy aftertaste.
"The odor of this brew is almost enought to cause second thoughts, but the flavor is well worth it. Despite the claims, this is NOT the world’s best pilsner, but the fine bite, pleasant wheat and smooth barley flavors make it quite worthwhile."
"BLBF. Was surprised by this one. Light marijuana aroma. Orangish yellow pour. Rich wheat malt and yeasty bready goodness. Finish is dry, but really decent. A departure from the other beers I’d had this evening. Yum."
"Dark golden color with a nice head. This is a really good beer, but im not surprised since it is czech. It has a fresh and clean taste with a nice bitter finish."
"500ml can, golden color, with a frothy white head, floral hops, pale malt, tangy hop note in the nose, follows through on a medium-bodied palate with a sweet malty accent, crisp drying hops flavors, leading to a good bittering finish."
This was a great Bohemian style pilsner.  The Hops to Malt complexity was awesaome.   Rich and spicy malt tone.  With a great crisp and bitter flavor.  A very good beer with a great flavor.  Always drink fresh can sit too long at times coming over.
Clear gold. Zero head. Little peppery flavor. Tastes a bit macroish. Refreshing but nothing special.
"A sour smell, this was not skunky at all.  I was not expecting this beer to be this good.  I won’t wait for a sale for the next 12."
"this is not as good as I remember. Cource, tonight, I see it in a corner shop, not the liquor store, and here in quebec when a liquor store beer goes depanure, it normaly meens it’s being brewed by someone local. Pours a very pale yellow, thin whispy head, minimal laceings. Aroma is not nice, sour corn dancing with cheap malt. Palat is kinda thin, with a very thick carbonation, standard. Taste is fairly standard american pale lager, wich is even more evedence that this is not the real macoy, just a facimily in the same bottle. Light sweet malt, corn, and sogrum dancing with a VERY light tra…"
"Being the original has its advantages (see Paulaner Salvator, a very good beer, but nowhere near the best in its category), however Pilsener Urquell doesn’t need the advantages. It is simply the best pilsener on the planet, apart from its lineage. Its deep golden color is unique in pilseners, as is its 
maltiness and sublimely spicy bouquet of Saaz hops, which evolve from bitterness to delicious flavor to, of course, uniquely spicy aroma. I have tried Budweiser Budvar, it…"
"Great with German or Czech food and the finest Pils available...

Use to be pricey but, has come down due to increased availability and popularity.…"
"Really quite good. A glass came with the pack I bought. Goes down really easy, and nice and flavourful. A great change from the mass produced beers that I am used to."
so this is the Pilsner that started all pilsners...  crisp and clean but tastes like liquified toast and has a gag tickle from where the toast is burnt...  guess I’m not much for pilsners.
"It is skunky but I love this pilsner.  Probably one of my favorites.  Believe it or not, it is good with lemon."
"Pours orange with small white head.  Nose is hoppy and a little sweet.  The flavor is dry, mildly bitter, with some spice, slight musty flavor, lots of hops flavor.  Fairly crisp.  Pretty good...is this what American lagers are trying to emulate?"
"660ml bottle. Mild hoppy, yeasty aroma. Average size white head which didn’t last too long.  Clear yellow/golden colour.  Moderate bitterness, slightly acidic flavour with a surprisingly long bitter and slightly dry finish.  A historically important beer, just not one of my favourite styles."
"Minimal head on top of golden orange liquid. Classic Saaz hops aroma, with a hint of spice. Dry and bitter, this is how one expects a pilsener to taste. Then again it is the original so I suppose that has to be the case!!"
Classic pilsner with a very good aroma and nice fresh bitterness. Should be enjoyed from tap
"My old review wasn’t that informative, so I decided to update it. I still stand by my rating of the beer. 0.5l green bottle. It’s not a fresh sample, but it sure wasn’t skunky. Poured a deep golden colour, with a big fluffy white head that went completely away rather fast. I didn’t notice much lacing. The nose was faint (the beer was cold, so it figures), but it was malty, honeyish. The taste was nice, with a nice hoppy foreground and a subtle and pleasant malty and lemoney background. Good hoppy aftertaste. Flawless, but far from flashy.…"
light amber with a white head.  Aroma was that of a standard pilsner.  Flavor was bitter and hoppy.  Not that impressed.  Will try on tap in Europe and rerate
"Not a bad pilsner, rather smooth with a crisp finish, although the hops aren’t as powerful as some of the american craft version.  Good beer to segway into better beers."
"good pilsner from its birth place.  classic pilsner taste, very hoppy, little skunky after taste bu the clean crisp taste comes from a very well balanced beer.  good stuff."
"Golden pils with thin white head. Grassy grainy malt aroma with nice crisp hops. Saaz hops come out of the crisp chalky malt, nicely balanced. Medium bodied. Classic."
"what bud should be, this stuff is cheap clean and crisp.  no one will take offense to it and you can drink it anywhere and not get too many looks"
"Hyom a bottle - Why does everybody else rate this beer ungodly high? Look, folks, it’s a Pilsner, a hopped up version of the Anerican Standard brew. Sure, it’s way better than ,say, Bud, but it’s not a personal favorite."
A light aroma a crisp golden color.  Has a nice white head.  Nicely hopped but could use a bit more malt balance.  Has a nice mouthfeel.
Bottle.  This is good but a bit skunky’er than I expected. I did not pour this in a glass so not sure how the aroma or head was but it was a smotth sippin beer that went well with smores.
"pored golden with a thick long lasting white head, aroma of skunkiness, malt, and yeast, the taste is bitter, and malty, not bad just wasnt impressed."
"Served from a 330 ml bottle into a 1500 ml. glass.

Sparkling, golden pilsner whose slightly bitter taste, in addition to this quality puts it ahead of most other beers of it’s type.…"
"Bottle. Pours a sparkling gold with an average size white head. The aroma: skunk, skunk, skunk. Stupid green bottles, when will they learn? After the skunkiness subsided a bit I could smell some grainy malt, yeast and a tiny touch of hops. The flavour was dissapointing, it’s too malty, too bitter, the palate is harsh and the aftertaste is quite unpleasant. Not sure why this is rated so high? Must be much better on tap. This should be much smoother than it is. Better than some of the macros but I certainly won’t be getting it again."
"Bottle. Golden with a fine lasting thick head. Malty aromas with lots of Saaz hops as well. Grainy taste and flowery hop notes. A bit less bitter than I remembered it, but maybe it’s just me who’s had too many IPA’s since I first had this one years ago....? A delicious pilsner."
"I admit I’ve never had this on tap, and it comes in green bottles here, so one thing comes to mind, skunk.  I would probably enjoy this if it weren’t for the stinky aroma, it pretty much ruined it for me."
"Bottle. Orangy gold, thin white head and moderate condition. Gentle grassy hoppiness and low malt in the nose,  Soft in the mouth with and initial  sweet chalky graininess nicely balanced out by a solid flowery hop note. Lingering dry hoppy bitterness in the finish that has some underlying honey teasing the tongue."
"Bottle. Golden color with a thin, small white head.  Aroma was skunky, hoppy, and grassy. Taste is light with some hops and a bitter end. Leaves a little residue in the mouth, light to medium body. Nice mouth feel."
This beer has a golden body - hue apperance and a coarse white scum collar. I have drunk the beer from the bottle and it had a lot of carbonic acid. The initial flavor taste is bitter.
"Blech.  I’m hoping that I just caught a light-spoiled specimen here... but I won’t drink this again until I find it on tap.  Very skunky aroma, not unlike a shoe... but points were given b/c I could detect some Saaz hops in there.  Clear bright-golden pour with light off-white head.  Unpleasant finish was remniscent of the aroma.  Well-carbonated.  The whole experience was unpleasant, but it got even worse when it warmed a bit."
Poured a golden color with a smallish white head.  Aroma was a bit skunky with some bread and a small amount of hops.. Flavor was a bit of sweet malt and some light hops and a nice bitter finish.. Light mouthfeel.. Good summertime brew.
"Normally I get the ""light struck"" skunky bottles.  I have had the occassion to taste on tap however.  Nice spicy hop aroma, nothing smells quite like a Saaz hop. Very nice rich golden yellow color.  A little on the bitter side for a Pilsner, but since they were the first, you must give some leeway.  Overall Highly recommend on tap.  Be very suspect of the green bottle sitting on the shelf..."
"I gave it a nineteen only because this is the original Plzen lager, the same birthplace of fine crystal glass ware. Before this, our beers were served in tankards and leather packs, and no one seemed to notice the haziness of their farmhouse ale. For it’s style, it is the Epiphany of that which seems to have destroyed the culture and lifestyle of beer entirely, and left in it’s path a trend towards macro-brewed adjunct-ridden cheap and nasty pale lagers with the option of being called a Pils, Pilsen, or Pilsener, bollocks!! Pours a clear gold with a large fluffy white head that lasted the distance.…"
"This pours a pure gold color with a medium white head.  The lacing is average.  The nose is clean and a bit hoppy and sweet.  The bitterness comes first with a light acidicity.  There’s mostly malts, banana sweetness, and peppery bitterness.  This is a very clean, nice changeup."
A very nice beer. Pures light golden with a thin white head. Nice aroma and complex taste. Slightly bitter.
Pours a thin golden color with an accompanying thin head. Aromas of sazz hops and a hint of malts. Tastes of a nice creamy bitter hopness that carries through to the finish with a slight maltiness. Like Miller Lite with more of a backbone.
Sharp aroma to the golden beer from way back. This crisp refreshing green bottled beer is the king of the euro style pilsner’s. A must try.
"Poured a deep straw yellow.  Wiff of corn on the nose and backed up by corn in the mouth.  Somewhat sweetish but in a unique way.  Smooth too, kinda grows on me.  Whatever that corn smell was, I didn’t dig it thou."
Probably the best of the Pilsner’s out of Czech in my opinion.  A very distinct taste as far as the biiterness.
"Golden with mostly receding head. Aroma of saaz.  Bready malt taste.  Moderately bitter finish.  Nice beer, albeit simple.  I enjoyed it."
"Pint Bottle.

Pours out clear golden, with a egg shell white head that lingers for a while, and leaves patchy lacing.…"
"Pint Bottle: Pours a nice fizzy white head which diminishes after a while.  The lacing is minimal, if any.  I think the most intrigueing quality about this brew is its aroma.  At the beginning and thrroughout I noticed weed and skunk smells (in a good way, if there is such a thing).  My wife and I decided to coin a term to describe this that seemed fitting: skunkweed.  Later, I also picked up on sweet hints of clover honey.  This classic is smooth and soft and clearly stands out from most pilseners."
"Good stuff!  Very rich, almost fresh bread flavor to it, complemented by just the right mix and right amount of hops.  Easily one of the better of the more readily available imports."
Solid pilsner.  Won’t overwhelm you.  Good to have during a hockey game for some reason.  Will definitely drink again.
"Reaqlly enjoyed this. Stunning golden colour and a complex, interesting taste and finish. Well above the average."
"NIce head , dark gold color, a nice taste witrh a little bit of bite, this beer has very refreshing quality."
"Bottles in the US are alright, with a tasty hoppy bite, but pretty thin and lacking in fruit flavors.  On tap (at least in Prague), it’s one of the better pilsners available, still having more bite than bubbly skunk like Gambrinus, but also fuller than the bottles."
"A good definition of a pilsener for the taster.  Bold, bitter, refreshing, good skunk.  A quality, widely available pilsener beer product."
"Delicious pilsner, dark amber gold, good head, excellent green hop aroma, slightly flowery palate with excellent balance and finish. If it were cheaper, it would be my standard ""have-in-the-fridge-at-all-times-beer"". Maybe its sacrilege, but I still like the Emerson’s pilsner better..."
"Hoppy aroma with floral notes. Luckily, no skunkiness at all. Bready, hoppy taste with some flowery notes, but a harsh bitterness in the finish. If it weren´t for the strange bitterness, this beer would be an excellent Pilsner."
Gold with a white head.. Skunk aroma. Mild hop and malt flavor. Bitter hop finish.
"(bottle) Poured golden yellow with some lacing.  Well balanced, but I remember liking it even more a few years ago."
"Firstly I’m very impressed with how cheap this beer is at the moment - $12 a six pack! It’s always a crapshoot getting this beer in Aus but these bottles were BB early 05 and kept out of the light. Even so I’ve had better PU. Anyway... the aroma is great as always, though it seemed to have lost a bit of its hoppiness. Some spicy Saaziness, but dominated by fresh malty, multigrain bread aromas and a touch of diacetyl. Flavour was not as good. Pretty thin, lacking the malt profile it usually (well, sometimes) has and making the bitterness the dominant feature. Somewhat one-dimensional flavour…"
"Good light beer, I really enjoy this on a hot summer day.  I do taste hints of apple in there, smells more hoppy than it tastes.  Quite a bitter aftertaste, but I definately like this stuff."
"After 1000+ beers tried, this is the first time I have ever had this beer.  Kind of strange.  Oh well.  Surprisingly, this is not skunked.  Peppery, spicy hoppy nose...spritzy.  Slight sweet notes.  Transparent golden color with a nice firm frothy white head.  Slightly sweet to start, turning slightly malty in the middle.  Finishes spiced and peppery with a hint of dryness and bitterness.  Crisp beer."
"Tasty, refreshing and delicous. Everything Budweiser wishes it could be... A nice break from the summer heat."
Bottle. Pours clear golden color with a whitish head. Strong hops aroma. Almost fizzy mouthfeel from carbonation. Well balanced and refreshing.
"Very nice golden color with a citrus aroma.  Permiating pilsner maltflavor that smoothly blend to a hop bitter.  Head was thick but dissapated to a thin covering that laced nicely.  The first of the Pils, and still a very good one."
"Great lawnmower beer. very clean and crisp in the way Budweiser could only dream of. I have had better, but this is very solid."
a boquet of wild grass and flowers. bitter pinches with a twist of malt. I just wish that more brands could get a pilsner going as good as this.
"Nice floral hop nose with a kind of crisp grassy feel to it.  Creamy white head on top of a golden body, pretty.  Flavor starts out smooth and finishes bitter.  Got hints of sweet citrus.  Very easy drinking beer.  Not bad at all."
Interesting aroma. I can’t put my finger on it. It smells sweet. It smells like a pilsner (duh). Clearly a saaz hop with a balance of malt on the mid-taste. Aftertaste was a bit skunky and i might drink it again if it crosses my face but i would not pusuit this beer.
"Bottle. Light amber with a small white head. Nose is hoppy and grassy with minimal skunky notes. Some light soughy malts as well. Taste is much the same. Light grassiness and hops with doughy malts and some faint citrus. Body is medium with a moderate carbonation feel. Finishes with grassy hops, hay, biscuits, and light buttery notes."
"Bottle. Clear straw, creamy white head. Big skunk aroma. Clean and malty with a slightly buttery and bitter finish. Both refreshing and satisfyingly complex. The body is noticably better than the last time I had it, a couple years ago. Really a well made lager. Now if they could only get a brown bottle."
"The perfect beer to quaff for pure relaxation purposes while remaining dignified. Not very flavorful, not very complex. Almost as refreshing as beer can get (I’d go with a framboise for most refreshing). It is what it is."
"Poured from a bottle in melbourne australia. The full body of this beer impresses me. Beers such as this one really do make the australian ""largers"" to shame, especially the premuim ones, such as crown larger or even VB or Carlton cold. Even if it may not be as fresh because of the export to melbourne, it still beats many local beers, especially any from CUB."
"I tired this a few weeks ago and It was quite good.

I liked everything about it more than the actual taste though. I was not a big fan of the after taste...It sent shivers down my spine...I couldn’t tell if it was a good or a bad thing.…"
"Don’t fool yourself. The best pilsner ever!
60 years after a world war, and these guys still have it!.AMAZING!"
"This was awesome for a pilsener.  i am not big on the style, but this is definitely one of the better ones i have had.  too bad most of em dont taste like this."
"Truly outstanding pilsener. Golden coloured, small head. Very crisp, slightly sourish and excellent hopbitterness in the end. Very wellbalanced and wellbodied for the style."
"Clear, pale golden hue. Thick, lush head.
Lively nose, pretty, floral, lightly spicy...dandy, with a dash of honey.
Neat hops on the tongue, with a long, welcome stay on the palate. 
Light bodied, dry, hoppy finish.…"
"I’m not the biggest pilsner fan in the world, but I was impressed by this beer, which I honestly had been avioiding prior to finding it on the ""top 50 most accessable beers"" list on this website.  Nice deep golden color and impressive hops.  Now I know what the original pilsner tastes like."
The mother of all Pils. Pleasant inviting aroma and a golden appearance.Poured with a small head that soon dissapeared.Quite bitter with a smooth sharp aftertaste.
"(Draught at U Zlateho Tygra, Prague)
Golden coloured, thick white diminishing head. Slight citric, hoppy nose. flavour from toffee with an acidic hoppiness. Watery, light bodied, low bitterness but still... absolutely wonderful."
"Distinctive czech hop smell. Very light gold pour with an average white head. Very flowery start with a dry, hoppy finish. Earthy aftertaste. A decent pilsner, but I’m going to chose Victory’s Prima Pils over this everytime."
"Skunky smell out of the bottle.  Little head poured out of the bottle.  Smooth, drinkable flavor when I got past the aroma."
Bottle - aroma is slight malt and slight skunk.  Looked like Budweiser.  Very little head and it was quickly gone.  Flavor was like the aroma.  Malt and skunk.  I’m hoping that this is just an old bottle.  May have to try again.  I’m certain that this beer is better than this sample.
"8/8/2004 (bottle) -
Reddish gold color, clear body. White frothy head. Nice fresh Saaz aroma. I’m trying to decide if I am getting occaisional skunk hints. It seems fine though. Taste is dry and lightly hopped grain. Seems a little papery to. Pretty good nonetheless. (7 / 4 / 7 / 3 / 14)…"
"Crystal goldenrod pour with a tall and airy white head (but little retention or lacing).  Hoppy, bright and floral nose.  Crisp citrus and bitter hoppy flavor with a very dry finish.  If you like pilsners, you can’t go wrong with this one but don’t ask it to be more than it is."
(Bottle 50 cl) Nicely golden with a decent head. Fantastic malty AND flowery nose. Very soft mouthfeel in spite of the very pronounced hoppiness - although it apperently has diminished in recent years. A very classic nice pilsener. THE pilsener...
"Skunky aroma when first opened.Nice deep head, but dissipates quickly with no lacing. Color is a beautiful golden color. Smooth taste with a small amount of bitterness in the finish. Good for a pilsner."
Pours with a nice golden hue and with a correct proportion of foam. Light malty taste with subtle dry hops incorporation.  This is my favorite pilsner thus far even though it originates from a large brewery.
"Light malty aroma with some citrus. Appearence is wonderfull, fully lasting creamy head. Heavy bitter flavour, with average duration. Soft carbonated."
"From a 12 oz. bottle

Pours out sparkling gold with little head. Lots of carbonation. Looks great.…"
"This is a pretty good pilsner, but too light for me. I gotta say its pretty good if you are limited to the local grocery store. One of the best on the ""common"" shelves."
"Bottle.  Pours a dark yellowish color with decent head.  Smells of grass and malt, a bit skunky but could be do to the age of the bottle and it being at World Market near flourescent lights.  Tastes of malt with a bit of floral hop flavor and then inter-mixes spiciness and bitterness.  Light and highly carbonated this would be a good lawnmower beeer."
"Not much for the nose and I hate to use this word but, crispy, a  good pils, but not my favorite. Ok"
Pours a beautiful golden color with a half inch white head.  Aroma was light malts and floral hops.  Flavor was malty but some upfront sweetness was present.  It is carbonated well and is another good beer for a warm summer day.  Quite drinkable and delicious.
"Nice golden colour with a small white head, I didn`t get much of an aroma with this,but it had a good classic pilsner taste.Good everyday beer,I could drink a few of these."
"Skunky hoppy and a bit malty aroma. Clear orange golden coloured. Head doesn’t last long. Taste is hoppy and moderate bitter. Excellent smooth palate.

Rerate. First day in Prague, first pilsener. Great experience. Well balanced brew. Floral and hoppy. Superb this pils."
"This beer, when poured from the bottle was light golden yellow in color, sparklingly clear and had a medium white creamy head that left good lacing on the edge of the glass. There was a distinct complex malt aroma with spicy, floral hop notes present. The flavor had a lot of initial hop sweetness mixed with an initial hop bitterness. The bitterness was not persistent however and mellowed quickly leaving a nice clean, crisp malt aftertaste."
"Great light beer; goes well with pizza. Well carbonated with a nice balance of hops, but kind of a funky, well-watery aftertaste. I could drink a lot of it."
Golden beer with fast dissipating white head.  Lively beer and medium bodied.  Smooth although a bit watery. Herbal aroma.  Moderately bitter finish.
niceley hopped and carbonated.  Clear pale color.  A little skuny.  Long bitter finish with little malts.  Good lacing.
"A very fine pils in my opinion, from the style’s home.  Nicely hopped, and well-carbonated.  My favorite international of this style."
"Nice looking beer. Rich Golden color.  Retains its head nicely, though it is small to start with.  Good lacing.  Taste is slightly water with nothing that sticks out flavor wise.  Honestly I was a little dissapointed."
"Poured a clear golden color with a small white head that quickly diminshed.  Some grassy and citrus hops in the aroma.  Slightly carbonated taste dominated by hops, light citrus, and bread as well, with a lightly bitter finish.  Damn nice on draft instead of the bottles."
"aroma is hoppy, a bit grassy. taste is same with a bitter hoppy finish......"
660ml bottle from Sainsburys. Excellent oily hop aroma. Good body. Long dry finish. My best Pilsner so far.
"Pours out nice golden color with a head.  Nice crisp, clean and hoppy flavor with slightly malt finish.  Not bad."
"Draft:  Golden pour topped with a nice foamy head.  Spicy oily aroma.  Suprisingly rich on the palate, with lots of spicy Saaz flavors.  Just a hint of butter and a bit of that ’tang’ that can sneak in there if a beer sits on attenuated yeast too long.  Overall, quite nice."
Really skunky this one is and a little off balance with the bitterness at the end.  The high skunkness and the bitter did not mesh well.
this is a great pilsner. bright color with a subtlle flavor and a very dry finish for me.
"Not bad.  Pretty up front with what it’s trying to do -- can be skunky, but overall it’s fairly clean and a little more dry tasting than other european green bottle imports."
skunky smell and a little citrus flavor that has a slighty bitter finish pretty good
"from the bottle. poured light honey with a nice size white head. aroma, malts, hops some skunkieness but not to bad grains. flavor, citrus, malts hints of sugar and a bitter sourness. not to bad, very easy to drink will make a good hot summer day beer to just throw down."
"It’s skunkeriffic!  Maybe I had a really bad bottle, but this is the skunkiest smelling beer I have ever experienced (except for the bottle of Heineken my buddy and I left in the sun for an hour just to see what would happen).  Pale yellow, little head.  Luckily most of the skunkiness does not find it’s way into the flavor.  Not hugely bitter, but the bitterness seemed very harsh.  Not something I’d like to experience again."
"Clear very golden color. smells decent I did detect a little skunk but oh well.  The flovor is strong but very pleasent sweetness and bitter meld together in an enjoyable combination.  I enjoyed this brew.  Got the tall boy 1pt. 6.3 oz bottle and I wish I would have got the sixer.  Very good Pislner worth the money you pay for it. All pilsners should wish to be this good, and we all know that there is a mess load of crappy ones.  Yummy!!"
"Poured a very golden color.  Average head that lasted a few minutes.  Had an aroma that was rather skunky, but the beer tasted good.  Strong flavor."
"Pours cloudy golden yellow with a tall white head and good lacing.  Aromas of citrus and hay malt.  Flavors of citrus and hay, much like the aroma.  Well balanced with some bitterness in the finish.  No skunk, this must have been a fresh bottle.  Medium body, almost creamy.  So this is what a pilsener is supposed to taste like?"
"Crisp taste, contrasts to the rough malt flavor.  Very drinkable, goes down nice.  Slight bitter, but otherwise, very little otherwise in the taste department."
"The classic pilsner.  Benchmark for the style with color flavor and mouthfeel.  NIce spicey saaz hop gives an evergreen crispness that balances the sweet moravian malt perfectly. The only thing wrong, a slight skunk on the nose courtesy of the green bottle.  Why the hell does Europe export beer in green and clear bottles?!?"
"Poured with a white head, clear sparkling body.  There was a kind of heavy sweetish aromoa.  The taste started malty and ended with some nice hop flavor.  Refreshing."
"Bottle with 7 months to go until use by date. Poured clear light gold with a small head which disipated very quickly despite giving the pour plenty of air. Suspect I have smelt my first skunk (we don’t have any of that particular animal over here in Australia, other than in some of our beers) - first aroma was unpleasant to say the least. Picked up a little grass under the skunk aroma, but not much else. Felt somewhat watery in the mouth, and the taste was dominated by astringent bitterness. Either I got a particularly badly light affected bottle, or I do not like the Pilsner style. Will be definitely seeking…"
Has a great golden color.  Looks a lot better than I expected.  Aroma of baked bread and hops.  Nice malt and hop flavor with a good dry finish.  One of the best commercialized brews around.  Perfect for tailgating or other activities which condone drinking a number of beers
"Sweet hoppy, dusty and clay aroma. Golden with a fast diminishing rocky head. Supter bitter taste also toasty. Long harsh bitter finish. To bitter for my taste but a good Pils"
"This has been a benchmark Pilsner for me for many years. When I was young and innocent/stupid I recall standing at the counter of a bottle shop, buying fosters or VB or something equally crappy, and being amazed that this guy was asking if they had this beer (showing empty bottle) from Czechoslovakia, when it still was. I wondered why anyone would want a beer from this place. Well, in 1999 when I made the pilgrimage to Plzen I left my wife in the coffee shop and went on the tour. So I now know that these ’Zatec’ hops do the real deal. When you open the bottle it yells HOP and for a…"
"Let me start by saying I’m sure this is a different beer when served fresh in the Czech Republic...but I had it in Kansas City and it was obviously not fresh, maybe even old. Light, golden yellow, with a hazy off white head. Skunky flavor, not real nice. Flavor is clean and crisp, but skunky as hell, in fact it is actaully pretty nasty. Clean finish."
"Good smooth pilsner.  This is what light beers should attept to taste like.  Great golden colour, definitely not overwhelming flavour, but good as far as pilsners are concerned."
Bottle. Wow this is how a good beer should taste. So much flavor and a good flavor at that.
"Tapped. Golden coloutm nediumsized white foamy head. Bready aroma with hints of fresh fruit and hops. Very smooth and soft palate. Flavour is mainly fruitish with hints of bread and a hoppy finish. The aftertaste is weak, but longlasting and mainly bittry. Very refreshing."
i bought a six pack of this and tried it. i wasn’t expecting much but this was a really great beer. it goes down easy with a good flavor and is very drinkable
"Rated at a bar on my 21st birthday. On tap.  Pours a clear goldenrod color, small white head. Aroma is malty. very feint, cigarette smoke obscures the aroma. Flavor is just slightly sweet and malty. Flavor is full and well rounded out. Very easy to drink and an excellent example of the style. Very flavorful for the similar beers in the style I have tasted! Thanks to Jane for the brew!"
"Pop one of these, pour it in a tall pilsner glass, and get excited.  It pours beautiful and has a nice, thick head.  It smells great, a combination of both malt and hops.  Flavor is the same, malty and hoppy... nicely balanced.  Nice full mouthfeel.  I’d love to try this fresh from a tap."
"Good - but nothing exceptional. It had that slightly skunked flavor and aroma typical of green bottles, but after that, it was fairly drinkable."
"Hard to argue with the original. It’s years since I had it on draught in Prague and the export bottled version doesn’t do it justice. Nonetheless, it’s still a model of sophisticated beer-making. Somehow it’s more than the sum of its parts. Gold colour, rocky head. Floral Saaz aroma with a hint of spice. Quenching palate. Smooth operator. Soft Moravian barley malt middle and a gently bitter finish. (Bottle)"
A nice smooth pilsener here.  Has great flavor with a colorful golden appearance.
"Miniscule white head, yellow body with few bubbles.  Aroma is grassy and herbal.  If you get a fresh bottle, the flavor is really nice.  Crisp and clean,  dry Saaz hoppiness carrying over into the finish.  A nice quaffable brew."
"Clear golden colour with small, quickly diminishing head...hoppy and floral aroma. A nice, bitter hoppy taste is balanced out with some malt presence too..nice finish. A real thirst quencher and one of the beers that got me into good beer."
Distinctive bitter hop flavour.  Maintains its pleasant bitterness even after multiple consecutive testings. The original and one of the best.
"On tap is the best way to enjoy. The next best is a 12 pack that hasn’t been punched for a handle, so to protect from light. The six pack is skunked 99.9% of the time. 

Buttery mouth feel. Hops and carbonation makes razor sharp. Firm dry malt framed so nicely by bitterness. Has never let me down, solid. Refreshes in hot weather and…"
"crips and refreshing. A medium body, hoppy and a little bitter, this all started with a beautiful gold color and pearly white head. I found it hard to sip, it had such a refreshing taste."
"the grandaddy of all pilsners.  a very beatiful and drinkable beer.   it’s perhaps my favorite pilsner, very refreshing."
"50 cl bottle, served in Urquell glass.
Dark gold w/ good-sized head. Pleasant, hoppy aroma. Crisp, somewhat bitter taste w/ a pleasant bite, and a fabulous, lingering, very distinctive finish. Easier to drink than water.
I never get tired of this beer, and I regret that I didn’t get around to tasting it some…"
"Bottled

Golden color, sparkling. Medium bodied, some malts. Fine hop notes, fresh, dry, astringent.  Very refreshing and pleasant bitter."
Bottle.Cclear amber color with large white head. Aroma has medium hop tone. Flavor is hop and and malt with a medium bitter hop finish
"Clear golden color with a thick white head.  Aroma of sweet malt and hops.Medium body with a rather soft, delicate mouthfeel from the water.  Starts slightly on the malty side but finishes with a long hop bitterness.  Nicely balanced.  This is light style for me but when I have a pisner this is one of my favorite. A classic."
"tasty, crisp, great cold. a weak, fairly simple beer. got a nice lil bitter bite, though, and a grainy breadiness to it. nice, effervescent nose with a bit of hops and citrus. golden with a significant release of gasses and a fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. you can buy this stuff in prague- a case of 24 pints costs 6 dollars U.S. wow. cheers."
"nice looking pilsner nice golden tan color with a slightly off-white head, dissapated to a soapy film rather quickly, smells slightly malty and almost bready, taste is alot like the aroma a real malty bready flavor with a slight touch of hops, I gotta hand it to those bohunks, they did ’er right with this bad boy, one of my favorite styles this beer provides a nice companion to my beef ’n barley soup I’m having for supper"
"Light fresh aroma. Nice deep golden pour with 3/4 inch head that dissipated fairly quickly. Light carbonation, dry palate that leaves a little residue. Slightly lemony taste with a nice bitter finish that lasts."
"Bottle, at home.
Light yellow. Light malty and hoppy (flowers) aroma and flavor. Moderate bitter finish."
Aroma of bitter hops stood out. Dark golden color with little of white head. Better than other pilsner beers I’ve had lately as it wasn’t strong bitter taste to it. Some after taste but went good with dinner.
"Very smooth beer, sweet and soft on the mouth, long malty finish.  A great Pilsner all around."
"Golden colour with big creamy head, mild hoppy aroma. I expected a big hoppy taste but found it to be quite malty and sweet, followed by mild bitter aftertaste."
"Tasted this beer many years ago, and since then I am trully a fan.  It has a sharp, crisp flavor with a long malt aftertaste."
"Medium gold to orange, a little darker than expected. Lively nose, good lift. sharp, some citrus and malt, quite crisp.

Plenty of fizz and bitterness in the mouth, very zesty. Flavour profile is quite broad across the tongue. Finishes a bit hard but still a good drop."
"Bottled in Pilsen. Biscuit and some caramel, bitter hops, and quite a bit of skunky aroma intially - though it seems to dissipate. Golden amber clear body with thin off-white head. Medium body with medium-high carbonation, smooth. Starts with good acidity and bitterness, some biscuit in the sweetness of the malt. Crisp overall, with a decent hoppy finish. After is medium bitter but otherwise clean. Decent pilsener."
"(Canned, 0.5l, bought from the brewery, BBE 06/2005) Deep golden color with a medium, foamy, quite tight and lacy head. Surprisingly mild and fruity aroma with metallic hints. Quite buttery and metallic, slightly sweet and malty flavor with grassy hopping. Light to medium-bodied, oily, bitter and slightly metallic palate with medium, sharp carbonation. A hoppy and refreshing pilsener, but quite sharp and metallic.
(Bottled) Deep golden-copper color with a medium, lacy head. Crisply hoppy and…"
"Bottle. Coppery-golden color, very clear with a medium white head that laced well...very malty sweet-wet socks/ wet dog, yeasty aroma. Nice round malty flavor well hopped. This is a really good example of what the pilsner style should be...too bad not many others can get it right,  I would get this again as it is the first pilsner I have ever really enjoyed. this would be a great lawn mower beer!"
Very crisp and refreshing.  Very fizzy head that lasts.  light to medium body.  perfect blend of sweet and bitterness.  but the best part about this beer is the palate.  lively carbonation with a light body that goes down smooth.  great beer.
"Clear gold w/ soft, billowy white head. Spicy saaz hop aroma w/ nice malt background. Soft, oily feel. Flavour is sweet,  malty (w/ underlying notes of honey) & hoppy. Finish is moderately dry, spicy & nicely bitter. Had on the North American side of the pond."
"Sampled out of the can, I’ve never dared to try it out of the green bottles.
Golden/straw yellow, with a fluffy head that died down into patchy clumps that floated around the light lacing, something I don’t recall ever seeing from any other pilsner, czech, macro or other.  Compared to most of it’s imitators, you can totally smell the grassy Saaz.  I’m not hop-biased, it’s just as good to me as Cascade or Hallertau or all the others when it’s given the chance to shine, like in this case.  Mid to light…"
"This was pretty good. the aroma was dominated with green apples. I don’t much care for the aenemic amber colour, but it did have a decent head with some nice lacing. Again with the hint of green apples in the flavour, some sweet(er) malt flavours finsihing with a bit of hops. No lingering aftertaste. Not my favourite style, but a good beer to drink cheaply and in mass."
I personally enjoyed this beer. It had the pleasant aroma of a cider. It poured a light amber color with a little bit of orange and plenty of carbonation. The appearance enticed me. The after taste didn’t last too long but it ended with a fruit flavor. Body was a little thin. Overall it was the perfect beer to drink at a yuppy bar.
"330ml bottle,only 55p from my local Safeway!!! Deep golden head with a respectable thick white head. Absolutely bursting with attractive hoppy/fruity aromas,soft malt coming through in the background. A medium bodied brew, with an amazing array of complex flavours...malty& fruity...fantastic.There is a sweetish malty finish combined with a citrus hoppiness. It’s been a while since I tasted this as I felt it had lost some of it’s character, I may have been wrong then,but this has got me hooked again! Superb"
"Quality is critical (and unfortunately variable) for this one. Evidently this beer does not travel/store well and can develop off flavors (a typical green bottle import problem). From a fresh keg, this beer can be superb-probably as good as any other Pilsner or Lager. Stay away from the bottled version. The variable quality of this one makes it difficult to rate. When fresh, this is a classic, hoppy Bohemian Pils."
"Poured gorgeous gold with center-fold quality foam.  Aroma of quasi-funky pils hops (I’m not a big hops guy), but I enjoyed the crisp palate and cool finish.  Some lingering after-skunk, though that could have been my specific bottle.  I may try it again."
Can.  Decent beer.  Obviously a great attempt at the style (HA!).  a little thin unfortunately and a little metallic.  I will try this in a bottle and re-rate.
"Golden color, hoppy corny aroma and taste. Medium body. ...................."
I poured a glass of this for a friend and upon tasting it he looked surprised and claimed that it tastes exactly how you would imagine beer should taste. Nice thick head. Clear and inviting with nice colour and aroma. Very enjoyable with a strong taste that finishes clean. Nice on its own or with food. Versatile brew that is a great one to give those who have never tasted anything but macros.
good looking golden color with a slightly tinted white one finger head nice flavor thats neither missing or overwhelming i will buy again
"One of the best beers ever.  I remember reading about this in 1979 and finally they started exporting it near me.  Clear nice color, even crisper head.  The flavor is bright, almost vibrant.  Smooth as silk & as good as gold (as is the color)"
"My friend Ron calls the best beer ever made.  I think he’s listened to too many radio commercials.  Certainly it’s a fine pils, but the not the best.  Good crisp drink, with a light gold color, thin white head, and tight carbonation.  Mild malty, doughy aroma.  Nice malt & hop balance, but not a very strong flavor.  Clean finish.  It’s just ""okay,"" Ron."
"Once,I wanted to debate the relative merits of several beers with a friend, and he, being very wise, stopped me short, handed me a bottle of PU, sipped his deeply and set me straight with these few, sage words, ""Quite simply the best beer in the world!""  And I thank you for that, Ron, everyday."
"Bottle & Tap: Clear golden yellow, white head.  Aroma is grains, spicy saaz aroma.  Taste is crisp, clean, dry with notes of grains, light malts.  A nice pilsner, much, much better when served fresh."
"Poured golden with a frothy white head.  Aroma is corn and heavy spice.  Taste is mostly abrasively bitter hops.  Thin bodied.  More flavor than other pilseners, but overall unbalanced and not terribly enjoyable."
"Decent sized head.  Creamy on top with great carbonation.  Dark gold in color.  Dusty, malt aroma with some hops (distinctly saaz).  Skunk upon opening but dissipates quickly.  Little bread also.  Flavor is malty and bready with a bit of bitterness from the hops.  More bitterness at the finish.  Not a bad brew and much better than most pilsners."
"Foam a lot fine and little long-lasting. Dark yellow color with glares amber. A lot interesting. Scent in the norm, enough fizzy. Fresh and full taste. Light but with a determined character. Much valid one."
"Bottle.Crisp and sharp,some hops.Average pilsner,on tap could be another story."
"Pours light gold, with a clean white head. Minty Saaz hops aroma. Not a big fan of Saaz, but of course they are essential here. Pleasantly bitter with mild soft malt and a very clean finish. Palate is remarkable. Quite light and delicate considering the significant hop presense. I was kind of sceptical at first, but this is really quite a good beer. A legend worthy of it’s reputation."
"Crisp taste, fairly even balanced and easy to drink. Slightly bitter, but still fairly smooth. I don’t drink pilsners that much, but this would be a good beer to relax with."
"Bottled (was a Christmas present)

Pale yellow-ish colour.…"
"Bottle.  Pours light golden color with a nice little lace and head.  Nose is a little biting and sour with some great Saaz hop... can’t wait for this taste again!  Clean, clear, crisp, biting bitterness... one of the best out there when it comes to a lighter beer.  Great body for a pils and I only wish that I was drinking one in the basement of  Plzensky prazdroj... Someday I’ll get there...."
"February 2003. A true classic: hoppy, flavorful, meaty and malty. The draught version is a real performance. [4.7]
January 2005. I’ve been trying this beer since 2000 (always on tap, in different places in Praha) and gradually it’s been losing its charm. It becomes hoppier and less malty, like an ordinary bitter. Still OK, but too far from its former unique status. [3.7]"
Pours clear in a pilsner glass.  Best enjoyed chilled.  Nice sweet aftertaste.  A very nice accompaniment to spicy food.
"My rating no: 100. When you enter the hall of fame at ratebeer.com and you can choose Chimay blanche or a Guiness or a Pilsner Urquell from Plzen from chechoslowakia then I choose the Pilsner as a tribute to the ""Urquell"" of pilsner beer. This is a pilsner which can have the name pilsner, refreshing not too bitter so very very good."
"Head recedes quickly...very, very little lacing (bubbles).  Decent hops flavor but leaves a kind of funky aftertaste.  Recomended by the friendly liqour store clerk as the best pilsner.   Last time I take his advise..average at best, money better spent on a 12-pack of any (except Coors) American mass-produced Pilsner"
"Tally up another one to smelling like a skunk.  It’s funny how that doesn’t make me pause from trying a beer though.  Ah, the things we do for the liquids we love.  Regardless - it’s a solid pilsener.  Hoppy and fizzy, but good bittering agents bring out a robust, sharp, clean and refreshing every man’s beer.  Commendable and dependable."
I have liked this beer for four years now.  It has a bitterness which is excellent.  On tap it is very good.  I recommend having a few other beers before it.
"My boss owed me beer and this is what he got me.  Gold pour, small head, active carbonation.  Weak hop nose, slightly skunky.  Gross weak and watery.  Little aftertaste.  Yuk."
"The original. Ah hell this is a damn nice beer. Head, lacing,  aroma a bit weak, bitterness. Lovely beer."
"What can I say, I’m a sucker for this stuff.  Crisp, refreshing, and pleasingly complex flavor.  Lots of layers and hoppy overtones in the finish.  A benchmark for me."
"The original, what can one say. This is a fine beer,but the skinky hops are somewhat aparent. This is a great summer time beer."
"Finally, a green-bottle beer that doesn’t suck.  Light orange/red with a small, white head.  Pleasant aroma of caramel and sweet malt.  Flavor also caramel and malt, some yeast (!), and generous bitters hops in the finsh.  Fairly thin but the stickiness makes it feel thicker.  Much better than expected."
"Golden, slightly bitter, but quite refreshing.  When I find myself wanting something a little lighter, this is a hands down favorite."
"It’s unfortunate, before the bottle is even completely opened, an annoying skunk aroma explodes from the bottle, transportation was long. Typical pilsner appearance, blonde, can almost see through it. In Mouth, malt is the first to bite your tongue, quickly followed by hops and a more than generous bitterness to dream of. 
 From a 500mL can: powerful saaz aroma, spicy, floral, herbal. Crisp medium body, very effervescent. Light toothpaste/honey maltiness. Very good although I’d like a bit more malt focus. Several layers of bitterness joins sip after sip, but it remains very w…"
"(500 ml can).  Creamy average to large white head, fully diminishing, less then fair lacing.  Very clear deep gold body.  A lot of spicy hops aroma (saaz) as well as strong caramel and some tones of bread and grains.  In my mouth, first medium high malty sweetness that rapidly fade away for heavy hops bitterness.  Precisely, flavors of sweet caramel and hops first then huge saaz hop bitterness that hides for good the initial flavors.  The bitterness is of long duration.  As for the palate, it’s a medium body beer which as some kind of mouthfullness first but at the end it’s mostly a dry finish…"
Yellow body with a white head. A fresh pilsner with a grasy aroma and nice hobs flavor. Has a dry aftertaste.
"Best of the main line pilsners, nice and bitter, with a golden body, and fresh aroma"
"I first would like to mention that i am fairly inexperienced when it comes to rating beers being that this is my first rating.  I enjoyed this beer very much after a long week of school and work, it was extremely refreshing, unfilling and easy to drink.  The taste is  pleasurable and somewhat simple.  This beer kicks the hell out of heineken in every aspect and is great anyday of the year."
"An almost perfect beer. The beer present it self with a’ nice white head, a’ hoppy and bitter taste and a’ lovely mouthfeel."
"The original is worth trying. Quite refreshing and well balanced. Try it, but I don’t know if I would buy it again."
"The original.  Yeah it may appear weak, watery, etc. like so many descriptions here. But remember - THIS IS A PILSNER!
Not a stout, not a porter............ Within the style of pilsner this is the standard. Full flavor and balanced.  Wait!  SAB bought this?  NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"
"anyways this used to be good anywhere in the czech republic a few years ago, a couple of years ago it was still very good anywhere in plzen, nowadays you have to go to the brewery to get the good stuff. at its best it’s still seriously bitter with a big floral aroma and some peachy sweetness and a buttery texture"
"I’ve had this beer on good days and bad, Good bottles, bad bottles. They should go to a dark bottle. I had a green bottle last night at the blackwatch pub in Upland,ca. This was the best of this beer I’ve had on draft or bottle, nice crisp pils, fresh,clean tasting. I will continue to drink this beer, but I can’t wait to have a fresh bottle again!"
A bit of a disappointment.  Light golden color with a quickly disappearing head.  Slightly bitter on the finish.
What was once my favorite beer now stings with a bitter aftertaste. Could be the beer...could be my developing taste. Too bad.
RERATE:  I had this on tap at about 10 bars in czech republic and it is sooo much better over there when you can get it fresh.  THis beer is outstanding compared to any other czech pils.  The thing you notice most is the smoothness and the hop aroma and flavor in the fresh version.  ALmost every  urquell I’ve had in the states is at least slightly skunked or stale- especially in bottles.  My new rating reflects the fresh version in the czech republic.…
"Bottle. Excellent carbonation upon cap removal. Great aroma-nice and hoppy. Nice amber-golden color visible even through the green glass. Taste is is pleasantly hoppy, with a good, crisp bite. The medium aftertaste that remains is more than welcome and is fairly tasty. Carbonation remains excellent throughout the whole bottle. A great beer to drink!"
"One of my favourites. Sharp, crisp, full flavoured. A saaz hopped beer, with lots of flavour and a pale malty prescence. One can see why this beer is copied so much, especially with a golden amber colour and a great white head."
"Mildly sweet, but with a dry, hoppy finish.  Good head.  Floral aroma.  Simply the ultimate pilsner."
I liked this one very sweet and less bitter than a heineken but the same type of beer i feel very good i had a 12 of these on new years eve awesome brew in my opion the first and definitve of it’s kind
"Somewhat odd aroma, suprised because the head was pretty well lasting.  Taste is like a watery hoppy brew with a slight tartness to the hops in the beer.  Decent brew for a hot day, but it’s starting to cool down, so forget about this one for 6 months."
"1Pt. 6.3 fl. oz. Bottle.  Pours a crystal clear golden yellow.  A nice head initially formed then fell quickly to nothing.  Aroma, well not much, hints of pale malts, some hot water bottle, and some very very metallic skunkiness.  Flavor is mild, very dry, crisp, light malt, and somewhat of a dry bitter finish.  Not bad. Mouth feel thin and tended to leave my mouth parched. Drinkability Low. Very very dry."
"Clear golden body with a thin white head of small bubbles.  That damn cheese smell that I can’t get over is still there.  But I did get some faint sweet malts too.  The cheesiness didnt persist in the taste, thankfully.  Bitter, floral taste with a kick of sweet before a bitter finish.  I am not sure if this beer should taste and smell like this, but I will for sure have to get it on tap to make sure.  Overall, not too bad though."
"Rerate Still a damn good pils, but notice a bit less sweetness this time and a little more saaz bitterness/skunkiness. Still very smooth and refereshing though.  Original 3.9  At first blush one thinks it is a Becks/St Pauli/Heineken clone - but it is much more than that.  Nice, even light malty aroma, tight, bubbly pour with a moderate lacing white head.  Golden appearance that has ""classic beer"" written all over it.  Not a pilsener lover but if I am going to have one - this is how I want it to taste. Nice sweet undertones accentuate the classic dry pilsener flavor. Stays strong throughout. Glad…"
"Bottle: Pours a clear gold with a big white, creamy head. Powerfull horsey, floral, wet grass aroma wafts from the glass. Up close this turns into more complex floral and citrus notes with musty malts and some light caramel. The flavour carries through with the malt tones, finishing with a toasty, grainy note. Some pronounced buttery notes (brown butter) with nutty undertones also present with the herbaceous hop flavour in the middle. The bitterness is well balanced, and a good full mouthfeel and long palate. Very nice."
"Pronouced pleasant hop aroma, good foam and lacing, malt flavours, medium plalte fullness. Good pilsener."
"Dark golden colored, big white lasting foam. Nice lace in glass. Good hoppy pils aroma, notes of caramel sweetness in there too. Mild sweetness comes up also in flavor, although ending is well hopped and dry. Good medium body, maybe some carbonation wouldn’t harm. About the 100th time that I have this, still I find something new every time. Excellent pilsner, something that other pils can be compared."
"A fairly strong floral hop aroma is present.  Pours to a golden color with a creamy white head, with moderate head retention.  Has a bit of a sweet-malty flavor before the hops come charging in to dominate the flavor.  Medium-light body.  A lingering, bitter hop finish."
"500ml can. Golden, fluffy 2-finger white head. Pleasant aroma of cut grass and straw. Sweet and creamy mouthfeel. Malt accented, some sweetness. Light, though lingering finish of hops."
"Can, 500 mL.  Clear golden amber color with rising bubbles and a decent white head that leaves lacing and sticks around a while.  Hoppy aroma, some fruit - a bit of peach and flowers, a touch of citrus, sweet grass.  

Tastes mid-malty, and hoppy with a vague, metallic feel in the finish, but maybe I am…"
"This pils has a moderate amount of aroma; smells floral and slightly fruity.  It has a hazy golden color.Urquell is a malty, crisp beer that finishes very smooth.  This is by far one of the best beers, that wasn’t an ale, that I’ve had."
"Golden hue with a light white head.
Very malty aroma, sweet and rich of cereal grains.  Flavor is also very malty, hop characteristic is subliminal. Has some notes of fruit in the aftertaste and is sweet, not very bittering.  Palate is light to medium with a smooth finish.  Not bad, but overpriced."
"Very clean and precisely balanced.  The standard for pilseners.  Hell, the original pilsener.  Very good beer, especially for the style, which I am not particularly partial to.  One I find myself always going back to.  This rating is for on tap in the Czech Republic.  Bottles in the US are not quite as good, but still better than any other in the style I can think of."
"Pleasant hoppy aroma, a little bitter, mostly a hoppy flavour and a lingering saaz finish."
"on tap and served in a 20oz PU glass from the PU promo girl!  yellow gold color, white head.  floral and honeyish aroma.  sweet and hoppy flavor.  enjoyable, unoffensive."
"Bottled from local bodega, Color is a crisp gold. head was gone in seconds,This was good, not skunky at all much better than expected, with the green bttle and all."
"This one caught me somewhat off guard, as I typically am not a pilsner/lager fan. However, on tap at least, this was very tasty and interesting. Smelled and tasted of breads and yeasts, with some pepper in the mix and a buttery taste. Nice, clean tasting finish. A good one."
Second time purchasing this.  I always see it at the local bodegas so i picked it up again to rate it.  Dank smelling aroma.  Head is very small and same with the oxygen bubbles. I noticed a sweetness along side being biter  but none the less very solid.  This pilsner has a unique style of its own and should remain an example.
"Draft at Mellow Mushroom Pizza in Mobile, AL
I was very impressed immediately with the complex and pleasant aroma and the orange/ deep golden appearance of this pilsner.  Very little white head and no lacing.  Nicely bitter and an enjoyable aftertaste.  My first won’t be my last."
"Lives up to its reputation.  A great pilsner from start to finish.  Although the green bottle, I have never had a skunked Pilsner.  Whether tap or bottle, it is surely to please the palate with the balance of malt and hops.  And is nice on a hot summer day."
"660ml Bottle. Can be a little prone to skunking, but when it is fresh it is superb. Good Saaz hop aroma and hoppy bitterness. Fairly dry tasting, lovely bitter finish. One of the best pilseners I have had."
"The first is still good.  Light golden colour, with no real head.  Crisp clean finish.  Tastes like what other beers wish they were."
Great classic czech pilsner with a nice golden body and long lasting head. A formula that is often duplicated but never replicated. A classic!!!
"Very nice pilsner, true to style (oh derrr)!  Moderate hoppy flavour with a dry bitter finish.  Gee the water in Plzen does taste good."
"I don’t often buy Pilsners, but tried this upon recommendation of a friend.  Have to say I was very impressed.  For some reason or another, this beer reminded me of the ubiquitous St. Pauli Girl, only much better.  A great, refreshing session beer that I’ll be buying again."
"12oz bottle: Believe it or not, I bought this beer because I saw a review on tv (thirsty traveller for those that know the show). A very balanced flavor, with a bit of hops for an aftertaste. All in all, a very good beer. I will definately be buying this one again."
"A fantastic beer.  I drank this often while living in Prague.  A visit to the brewery left me with a greater appreciation of the beer and of the process.  Now I drink Pilsner for its quite unique, sweet but tart taste and the friendly buzz it provides."
"(22.3 oz bottle) The Original Golden Beer, the standard by which all other pilseners are often judged, and justifiably so in my opinion; Very smoky pilsener with a tremendous amount of quality malt flavor for the style; Mildly bitter, but pleasant and balanced hops contribution; The only issue I have with this beer is that it’s a bit sweet, and I just don’t remember P.U. being this sweet years ago, or maybe I’m just paying more attention these days; The flavor stays pretty consistent from start to finish, except for a bit more hops presence in the finish, with a slight grapefruit flavor on the…"
Excellent Pilsner. This ain’t the model for pilsner because it’s far better than most it’s imitator’s. The finish is fantastic and I can still taste the nice Czech hops here 34 minutes after I had the beer :-)
"Golden color, light carbonation and a light white head. Nice sticky lacing. Aroma is a little skunky with hops and some background malt. Flavor is light, slightly sweet with a crisp pilsner hop finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied and effervescent.
I am not a big fan of pilsners, but this one is quite drinkable -- not overly dry."
"A nice golden color with high clarity.  Light aroma, crisp, but nothing special.  Something I could drink alot of if offered."
It was pretty good.  It was refreshing.  The aftertaste was not that bad.  I could drink another one of these.
"Used to love it more, but IMO has a funky aftertaste.  I would rather nail a Stella, Heineken or Grolsch any day of the week."
Clear amber colour with small head. Sweet hop malt aroma. Fizzy palate. Good to drink on a hot summer day.
Nice golden color with a white head.  Nice bitter hoppy taste.  I thought this was a pretty good brew.
"Chuckometer - 10 (you drink it quicker, coz of the bitter aftertaste keeps you sipping.)"
Roasty.. I got a distinct taste of roasted marshmallows from this drink.  Golden!  What I imagine a Pilsner is supposed to be like.
"29 June 2004 - Pronounced fruit malt aroma.  Clear golden orange, low head, suds lacing.  Nice bitter sweet malt balance, floral hoppiness that lingers.  Slight fizziness and a medium mouthfeel. Not being a big fan of pilsners this is definitely a pilsner I would be happy to drink."
"Excellent pilsener! Pours a beautiful gold with a white head. Aroma is of light malt, Saaz hops. Taste is refreshing, clean and sweet with a nice malt and hop balance. Mouthfeel is nice and full- the flavor just dances all over your tongue. Much better than most pilseners. Highly recommended, especially on a hot day. My bottle wasn't skunky at all."
"Bottled. Spicy, hoppy boquet. A great, clean pilsner with crisp bitter finish. My favorite next to Budvar."
"Canned. Bit of a grassy smell, but had some pissy and ethanol undertones I didn’t like. Otherwise fairly well-crafted; the bitterness hits you right away and has a short dry finish. A little thin at the end. Don’t let it get too warm."
On tap at Houlihan’s.  Pretty standard pilsener.  A somewhat bitter end to the taste.  Back of the  mouth tase.  Not bad at all.
Fair beer.  Probably much better out of the tap than after an Atlantic voyage and who know how long warehoused and stored.  Slightly more orange than the typical American pilsener.  Flavor is grassy.  Nice malt start and hop finish.
"Has a golden color and has a lot of flavor and bite, and a little bitter.  I guess I was expecting better but maybe i’m just not a pilsner kinda guy."
en excellent pilsner.  some sweet malty taste followed by a decent bitter ending.  of course the hops get less pronounced as you finish the beer.  a faint salty buttery taste.  often one of the best beer on tap bars around me.
Not my favorite style but about as good as it gets in a pilsner.  Can be stunning when fresh.  a good way to wean your friends off Bud now that it is widely available.
"All these years i thought this beer was crap, and off tap i was really shocked, turns out to be a damn nice pilsner. A nice golden color with a white head that leaves moderate lacing. Taste has some straw and light maltiness but is balanced very well with a good floral hop backing."
"Tasty stuff. Sweet, some hops, a lot of fruit. Very drinkable stuff. Get it while it’s fresh, green bottle will get to it very quickly."
"Clear Golden color with a medium head. Slightly sweet and malty aroma with a nice hoppy bitterness. SLightly sweet and slihglty bitter with a nice balance of malt and hops. Light bodied, crisp and smooth."
"Draft.  Dark amber color with a thin head.  Good hop aroma.  Very tasty hops flavor; not too strong, not weak.  There is almost some wood present.  I imagine this can be quite skunky when not on tap."
"Very thin head, with a great aftertaste that is slightly bitter yet a crisp cool and refreshing taste. Not bad for a fairly large produced commercial beer"
"A Crisp typical pilsner bight, with a hoppy, slightly fruity flavour.
Not a bad drop for a sunday afternoon, or a casual drink."
"Used to drink this a lot, I never realized it was actually a decent beer.  Skunky, grainy, corn aroma. Pretty good golden appearance, with a slight reddish hue. Kinda average pilsener flavor. Slightly bitter aftertaste. OK pilsener."
"I thought after the first couple it tasted good but it is beer and thats good cause beer is good although pilsners aren’t on the top of my list, but it is ok."
"Dark dark yellow with little head...looked like something you pee the morning after...smelled skunky and tasted skunky with a hoppy finish...it may be the original, but the original what?"
"Watery yellow, fairly skunky with moderate flavor. Sort of greasy texture. Not what I was expecting at all. Not buying it again."
"Clear, yellow body.  Off-white creamy head, virtually not lacing and mostly diminsihing.  Hoppy (flowers) and yeasty (dough) aroma.  Moderately bitter initial flavour and lightly bitter (averagely long) finish.  Lively carbonation."
"bottle. light golden color with a 1/4 inch head. hopped slight skunk smell, but not too off putting. interesting flavor. much smoother than i expected. there is a definite malt taste that is more powerful than i expected. the hops are present more at finish. this is the most flavor i have gotten from a pilsener. leaves a nice buttery flavor."
"This is a good import. I like its yeastiness and flavour, but it is not one I would regularly buy. At first, I really liked it. But I came to recognise it for the skunkiness that lies hidden within - perhaps you will notice, perhaps not - and if you want to know how the book ends you have to read it for yourself."
"Light golden color with a nice white head. Herbal and hop aroma. Nicely balanced pilsener. A little malty at first, then a nice slightly bitter finish."
"Draught in a 500ml shaker. Clear gold, white head& light carbonation. Good lacing. Grassy aroma. Good bitter taste, malt & some apple. OK mouthfeel. Bitter finish. Refreshing & easy drinking. Had four with a pub lunch."
"Finally get around to rating this one.  Draft at Jet Rock in the Philly Airport.  Not much to look at, and not much aroma, but boy is it yummy.  Perfect malt hop balance."
"RIch golden, with fine head. Some floral saaz, delicate nose. Crisp, light with mild hop finish...Nothing wrong with it though not very interesting."
"as far as a pilsner goes this is probably as good as i gets.  A big step up from budweuser, but still nothing I would buy again.  Very clean and light on the mouth, with a crisp finish"
"Crisp and clean. Not much nose to speak of. When cold it is actually very refreshing, but so is an ice cold glass of water. A great chugging beer."
"(on bottle)Being this my 100th rating, I´ve fallen upon the first ""exotic"" beer I ever had. The pilsner the other ones look up to and so on and so forth. So tasting it again, is it that good? Well, it has a nice fresh/grassy sent and a golden color to look at. What hits me the most is, that so many ""lower"" pilsners, allways has too much carbonation and too many hops. This one is round and good, fine balance. Good for a warm day of harvesting hay or something."
"This beer seems to be a hit or miss.  I’ve had a few that were really bad, sort of skunky tasting.  But, for the most part, the batches seem to be of good quality. When you get a good batch of this beer is tastes so refreshing. It’s not a heavy beer, but has good flavor, a nice balance, nice fruity and slightly bitter finish. If it weren’t for the bad bottles I’ve tasted, this beer would rate even higher."
"no head with this one; it has a slightly skunked aroma, some slight flowery/herbalness; smooth, maltiness up front with a slight  dry ending that slightly metallic and a nice floral bitter balance great on a hot day like today; a bit flat on the palate; I’d love to try this on on tap, or side by side w/a fresh Budvar. very nice, but I know can be so much better"
The initial aroma is of straw then a little bit of hops. The colour is burnished with gold with a solid white head after pouring from the can. The taste is pretty good bits of malt and straw and nice hit of bitterness on the finish. A great thirst quencher.
"golden urine color with slightly pissy aroma. high carbonation,tangy hoppy finish,,dull/soso,,wont buy again and am surprised at the 67 rating"
"Bottle. Thick frothy white head that fades to a bubble film. Nose is strong of hops and skunk. Decent bitter bite. Notes of malt, hops, a little spice and sweet. Finishes very clean without the usual pilsner aftertaste. Not bad at all. This beer is a little more complex in taste than I thought that it would be."
"Nice golden ""classic"" pilser appearance. High foamy white head that dissipates rather quickly. Not very lacy, it seems to leave an oily-like residue in the glass.

The only thing I could smell in this brew was a grassy/grainy type aroma. The taste was a little more impressive, with a hint of lemon added to the grass, grain, and…"
"It’s my favorite available beer. The first and original pilsner. Golden colour, full flavour from best hop and špure czech water. Exellent!"
"This brew is decent I think. Nice golden color White foamy head that dies. Nose is excellently woody and hoppy. Notes of oregano, aftershave a czech forest. Tasty as well
Grat"
"Wow, I was not expecting much from this, and the pilsner style is not one of my favourites at all, but I have to say I really enjoyed my bottle of this at the cottage.  Surprisingly strong hoppy aroma after a golden pour that showed evidence of active carbonation.  Fizzy white head, quickly dissipated.  Nice slightly citrusy hop bite in the taste and a good malt balance.  Yes, I am still describing a pilsner.  No skunky flavours to be found.  I quite enjoyed this."
Thankfully this one came straight from a box and was not exposed to light.  A nice lighter beer with a good dose of Saaz.
"Pours medium amber.  Good stout head and the lacing almost coats the glass completely.  Thats about the bes I can say for this brew though.  There is a honey flavor here, like the Warsteiner.  Also though and especially on the aftertaste is a metallicslant.  Like biting on timfoil or a rusty nail.  Very little hops taste and a smmoth mouth feel.  Don’t think I can finish this one."
"Pours pale yellow/golden with a small head. It had that slight skunk flavor to it. Light taste. A decent pilsner, but not something to go crazy about."
Golden coloured. Refreshing and round. It has a nice head and and perfect aftertaste. The Saaz hops and the unique brewing tradition has produced a real classic.
"Crisp golden pilsner. Excelent aroma, light but fruity, very hoppy. A favourite."
"this is one that everyone loves...and they should. its the gold standard for pilsners. crisp, refreshing, beutifully golden and nice warm malty flavors. ive been lucky enough to have drank many of these in the czech republic where the beer flows freely in large mugs that only cost about $1. the bottled stuff we get here is pretty good as well. i always have some on hand for my pilsner drinkers...no bud light in my fridge. you have to rate this high because it was the first and everyone has tried to replicate it after. more on longevity and standard then complexity."
"Very drinkable, good, crisp pilsner that’s good for a light change of pace.  Found it similar to Becks, but not quite as skunky.  Definetely not a favorite, but not bad either."
Strong aroma of Saaz hops. Bright yellow sparkling appearance. Bitter aftertaste with a balancing malt flavor.
"Bottle
Very fresh hoppy aroma. Quite big white head. Appearance very clear, golden. Bitterness which has some bite - but not too heavily plus grass flavour which stays long enough to make drinking enjoyable. (9/3/8/4/15 3.9)…"
"Recommended by a friend who loves czech beer. I was disappointed having tried it at O.C.  Light Color, prett bland."
"A great brew when you're downing a six pack.  Smooth drinking with some hoppiness - a modle for the macros, proving that you can pump out a beer with flavour that has mass appeal."
"Citrussy saaz aroma.
Golden, low carbonation and head, some residue floating.
Light malt base. Hops hide well, slight bandaid.
Bready aftertaste, light hop dryness.…"
"Bottled, Pasteurised. Golden beer with thick white head, highly carbonated. I really enjoyed this pilsner, great clean dry flavours, sharp and definite in its aims. Refreshing and juicy, pretty decent."
"Draft - the keg that I got this from must have been old as I was not as impressed as I thought that I would be.  It had a skunked aroma and the taste was ""off"" somehow.  I will probably try again, just to see if I like as much as everyone says you should."
This is my favorite overall.  I do think it is somehwat of an acquired taste.  The bitter saaz hops probably aren’t for everyone.
"Poured into a pilsner glass: deep, clear gold with a medium head that quickly disappears, leaving a thin, yeasty froth. Strong aroma of malt, slightly sour. taste is bittersweet and malty. A good beer altogether."
A rather odd taste that takes a few to get used too.  Dark gold with a nice white head.
"Darker, but fully clear gold beer, good carbonation to good, reasonably persistent white head. Very clean barley malt nose, light but obvious aroma of warmed summergrain. Suspicion of noble hops. Taste is foremost sweet malt. There’s virtually no bitterness - more’s the pity. This has become a very polished product. Impression, both organoleptic and subjective of a very fresh, still warm, (snow)white bread - from an industrial oven. Light to medium bodied; finish is more watery (retronasal even a bit metallic, coppery). Not bad, but (too) sweet. All the same, a far cry from the…"
"Bottle: Poured a golden beer with a standard head with more or less retention. Carbonation is quite standard. Aroma is a bit floral with some malt coming out also. Taste is also floral with some note of malt. This is a very light and refreshing beer. The beer might have been a bit skunked, which seems to be a recurrent problem with the Urquell; they don’t seem to stand the long trip from Europe to America very well. I find that the can version usually preserve itself better the the bottle version."
"Bottled: Light golden with a nice head. Has a sweet malty aroma. The flavour is balanced and hoppy. Great bitterness in the aftertaste. Very good pilsener. Dosn""t pretend to be more than it is."
"Are there really significant hops in this beer - coulda fooled me.  Everything is average or below here, sans aftertase - which is supposed to be a hop bite.  Reality is that it is a skunk bite."
"First sip a classic pilsner and then some malt, and then.. Then all downhill, like tasting rusty metal, and not even in a can. Strong burning aftertaste of bitterness and attacking carbonation."
"The very first Czech pils that I ever had. It hooked me on to Pilsners from then on. I loved that fact that it wasn’t strong in alcohol, but had an abundance of flavour. In Canada, we have so many crappy beer that have high alcohol content without a distinct aroma or flavour. This pilsner brought me back home - it made me believe that there was a true artistry to brewing."
Ah ... the simple pleasures of a first class brew.  I’ve noticed some travel wear in the bottled versions.  A great tap pour will treat you to a deliously smooth and subtle pilsner style with enough hoppiness and a tad of bitter flavoring to refresh.  A beer well done.
"Straw yellow, nice white head.  Light struck, skunked, why do they put beer in green bottles? Some grain and saaz hop aroma on the nose otherwise.  Slightly grainy malt flavor.  Some bitterness in the beginning softens up leaving a slightly sweet ending.  (True to the style that they defined.)  Thin but crisp body. A clean refreshing beer, if they would just package it so it wouldn’t get skunked.   Buy it in a sealed 12 pack or case.  If it has been in the light, beware."
"Good healthy head.  Initial skunky scent evaporated to almost no aroma at all.  Golden straw color.  Got better as it warmed.  Straw, barley flavours.  Clean finish.  Was expecting a stronger hop presence."
"Bottled - 330ml. Wonderful golden body with a thick foamy white head. Medium carbonation. Good floral nose with hints of malt and hops. Taste is nicely balanced and evolves from refreshing sweetness to a long and definitely bitter final. A classic among my favorites, especially when served on tap."
"Not nearly as good as I thought it should be.  Poured a skunky smelling cheap yellow fizzy liquid. Aside from the skunkiness, there is also a hint of cheap malts, hops, and something metallic on the nose.  Taste is pretty bland, with the slightest hop spice and a odd metallic flavor.  Bitterness is acceptable.  Needs more of everything except that metallic thing."
"Had this beer in Prague itself... very nice change from the British stuff. Finally discovered a lager I really like, that has some flavour. Deep gold colour, not too much fizz. Not much head, can be thin, but not when it hasn’t travelled too far."
This beer is great value at the moment at $11 a six pack at Dan Murphy’s. Rapidly becoming a victim of it’s own success these days. Has defintely lost something over the years. Does not have that wow factor that it had when I tried it 10 years ago. Is it me or have they dropped the bitterness perception somewhat? I still never detect any of the so-called diacetyl that some say it has. I must be thankful though that it’s become more readily available these days. At $1.50 more per sixpack than crappy VB it represents excellent value for money nowdays.
"Finally got some bottles that weren't skunked. First Pilsener I've really enjoyed. Kind of grassy, grainy, on the sweet side. I could taste a little hops but not that much, very mild all around. Pleasant sweetness, I drank most of the 6-pack."
"straw pour. yellow, small head... clean, farm aroma. the greatest bite of grass i ever had... nice! i don't mind at all. time to fly to the source and drink it fresh, damn it... i hear too many good things about this, but it's failed me everytime. UPDATE: still, a good brew. the grass bite had some metal blades this time around, and it's golden with big bubbles. the head is relatively small and white. the aroma matches its flavor in near equivalence. hmm, it's good. the palate could be worked on as well. it seemed a bit sharp, although it had some pleasant creaminess to it."
"On tap at ""Big City"", Allston MA. Gummy and yeasty tasting, hardly what I expected from the label.  Strange infidelity in color.  Not terrible, but I expected more pungent notes, even if it is mass-produced."
"Fresh, hoppy aroma as expected.  Poured a mid gold colour, with a nice white head that faded just a little.  Great balance, with it difficult to decide if it is dominated by the hops of the malt.  Hard to top in this style."
Probably one of my favorite readily available beers.  Has a great bitter flavor up front and is genuinely smooth going down either on tap or straight out of the bottle.
Pretty good beer with a decent balance of flavor.  Light clear and refreshing with a good amount of foamy white head.  Very good for the style.
"a beautiful Pilsner, one of the best. clean crisp with that hoppy aroma. A definite favourite"
"Bitter, but also aromatic. Perfect for long sessions........................"
"This is great pilsner! Crisp, clean flavor that went down smooth and left no bitter aftertastes like some do. Very enjoyable."
"Bottle: Orange yellow with a medium head. Aromas of herbs and spices with a equally herbal, spicy and bitter taste. I can understand why this is THE standard for pilsners."
Bottle:  Not much of a head and what head there is dies rather quickly.  Slight lacing.  A very nice clear golden color.  Medium hoppy floral aroma.  Not a very strong tasting beer but a good blend of hop and malt flavors.  Medium carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel.  Slight hoppy aftertaste.  A very good pilsner.
"Re-rate.  I'm still annoyed that they put this in green bottles, but I've had enough quality samples now to warrant a re-rate.  Faint malt in aroma, light floral and herbal hops.  Pale golden color, thin white head.  Flavor possesses a rich maltiness, just clean pale malt, with accents of Saaz hops, and a solid hop bitterness.  Medium body.  Crisp and refreshing, malt and hop flavors are crystal clear."
"The mother of pilseners! Clear dark yellow body with a fine head that dies quite fast. Good hoppy aroma and flavor. But like most other pilseners I find it quite uninteresting and bland. It's not that I don't like pilseners, on a hot summer day they are perfect, I just guess that after discovering the great world of beers I find them quite tasteless and boring. Pilsner Urquell is one of the better ones on the market and deserves an extra point for beeing the mother.....!!!"
"One of the best beers I've ever had.  The price of a case is a bit pricy around $30, but is definately worth it.  Very thick taste, yet with a golden flavor."
"Found a bottle that seemed reasonably fresh. Nice golden colour, thick white head with lacing. Aroma is floral and saazy. Flavour isn't so heavy on hops that the malt is forgotten; a nicely balanced flavour. Fizzy, yet firm in the mouth. A classic that didn't dissapoint. Bottle."
"The standard of pilseners.  Pours a light golden color, looking like a mamby-pamby lager, but then it lays the hops on you with a delightful bitterness.  It's no more expensive than the likes of the standard imports in my area at about $7.50.  It's the way a Pils should be."
"Draft:  Deep gold w/ a lasting pearl white head.  Aroma is of a stronger diacetyl than I'm used to in this one. Grainy malt sweetness, and light flowery hop.  Flavor is malty but balanced by a very pleasant bitterness in the finish and hop flavored aftertaste.  Medium bodied, moderately carbonated, and smooth mouthfeel.  Overall a good beer, but I'm not in awe of this beer by any stretch of the imagination."
Wonderful Saaz!  I just love this beer in every way.  Beautiful golden color and lacy head - smooth yet spicy - may I have another?
"Proper color, superb hoppiness in both taste and aroma.  Dry with a big (but not obtrusive) hops aftertaste.  Beautiful Belgian lace, but low in the bubbly department."
Pretty darn good for a macro beer. A crisp refreshing beer with some bitterness and sweetness.
This one is easy to sum up.  Harp's Lager minus the wonderful aroma with a little less taste.  Can I be more concise?  I think not.
"Spicy saaz aroma. Clear golden colour with large bubbled white head that recedes to cover. Strong, spicy bitterness is the dominant flavour. Medium light body and long dry finish. Perhaps not best of style (overbalanced towards bitterness) but a decent beverage all the same. Bottle (green)."
"One of my first favorite ""real"" beers. Fantastic on tap, beautiful straw color, effervescant white head, strong hop nose. Crisp smooth finish with a nice hop bite at the end. A great drinking beer."
On tap - Slaughtered Lamb Greenwich Village.  A slightly creamy aroma more characterful than most pilsners.  The colour is golden but over-carbonated.  Flavour is slightly creamy and wheaty.  Not bad for a pilsener and apparently much copied.
I misjudged this beer initially after drinking it from a bottle; on tap it is more flavorful and well worth your time.
"A good, crisp pils.  Yelloe coloredwith a subdued head.  Aromas of citrus and hops.  Has a smooth hoppy taste, with a crisp, clean finish.  The green bottle have got to go, though.  I've had skunked bottles of this."
"Golden, yellowish in color with a small head.  Slightly bitter in taste, but in a pleasant way.  Good beer for drinking on a hot summer day."
Bottle. Grassy hops aroma with some maltiness and black pepper. Just enough bitterness. Seemed to be a slightly old sample and a bit tired.
On Draught Clear light gold with a small snow white head. Fresh grain aroma with a nice bit of hops to boot. Thin body and crisp with a slight bitterness in the finish that lingers. Flavor is fresh grains and not much else. The classic Pils. Refreshing and a great companion for a sandwich.
"A very solid golden pilsner. The flavor was quite hoppy, with overtones of rose and other herbal type notes. Satisfying without being mind-blowing."
On tap this is some of the very best of its type. Old bottles are the reason some rate it low and they can be real bad. This rating is for a fresh pint on tap
"Can 500ml. I've tried a number of these but always from a bottle and of corse I found them skunky, hoping for better results from a can. Poured a rich golden colour with a creamy inch thick head. Hops in the nose and somehow I'm getting a hint of yeast, I must be wrong I'll re-rate later, some floral hints as well. The flavour is quite good. Hoppy, dry, good carbonation, lingering hops finish.I liked this from the can and despite the 2.27cnd.per can price tag I will buy more in the future.Good summer drinkin' I think."
"As a newbie I have a hard time identifying different hops, but after trying this I'll always know Saaz at least. I was surprised and pleased with the dryness of this beer, and not so much with the bit of skunkiness I detected.  A good pilsner I suppose, though I'm not a big fan of the style.  My friend says that this is much better hand pulled in the Czech Rep."
"Pours real nice almost golden color. Nice active white head, disapates quick but leaving a fair lace down the glass. Smells of grain, hay, a bit medicinal and skunky but hints of hop are present. Taste is sharp as the skunk smell really didn't pull through. Bits of grain, hay and malt up front with it blending pretty well in the middle. Finishes with a snappy hop zip, along with a pinch of salt along the back of the tongue. Perky, light with a feeling of indistinct normality. This slides right in with the Heineken Lager, Tsing Tao mix very well. Don't expect anything overally complex and you wont be let…"
"Tried this in  nice pub, the name of which escapes me, somewhere near the Old Town Square (not that it matters as this beer is near omnipresent in Prague), accompanied by a plate of gnocchi and cheese. The best Czech beer so far - tried before at home, but never this good. Rich, golden tone, average head and lacing, and quite fizzy. Bitter sweet flavour, which is refreshing, crisp, dry, and biscuity. Perfectly balanced, full, and vastly swiggable. Surely the pinnacle of the style."
This is a good pilsner.  Pours a medium gold colr with a nice big head.  Aroma is slightly herbal with some other hop/malt notes.  Flavor is hops an with a quite dry finish.  Nice rich body.
"An Pilsner that is clearly the standard bearer (as can be expected from a beer brewed in Pilzen, Czech Republic). I let a committed bud drinker sample this, and it made him excited about trying micro brews. Pilsner is not my favorite style, but I can recognize a classy brew when I taste one. The only negative is the lack of a distinct personality. Otherwise a thirst quenching, satsfying, and very welcome addition to my refridgerator. I can get this at $9.99 a 12-pack at a very fresh quality. If I drank a lot of beer, this is what I would buy every time."
"This one is very hard to rate because it really will come down to a matter of taste.  amber color; potent aroma; stiff aftertaste that isn't all that pleasant after the first drink or two, but gets much better; foamy head that quickly disappears - something I may have to try again."
This brew poured a small head of fine to large sized mostly diminishing white bubbles and a softly carbonated transparent orange amber colored body.  It has a mild hop aroma and a clean mild malt hop flavor with a smooth mouth feel that contains just a hint of tingly hop after bite.  This is indeed a very nice Pilsner.
"Tap.  3/14/03.  The beer poured a more golden color than I had expected, nice and rich looking (funny, after writing this, I looked up 'Bohemian Pilsner' in the style guide and found that that is exactly what it should look like).  This is certainly not the first Pilsner Urquell I've, but the first I've paid attention to.  This has to be the standard for the perfect amount of saaz aromas.  Nice and peppery and herbal.  Quick brisk, slight bitterness to its nice dry finish.  Obviously, I cannot say anything unique about this beer.  I've had much more tasty pilsners, but you have to respect this one for its…"
What can I say?  It's the original.  Classic Pilsner in every way.  Very nice.
"Too often ruined by the journey (long bloody journey at that) from the Czeck Republic to Australia. I'm still amazed at the the seductive flavours of saaz. Sometimes ruined by a green (skunky as many of the North Americans call it) character, but sometimes you get lucky, and get a lovely soft honeyed, floral saaz character. Makes me wonder how good this stuff must be on tap in Plzen. many people say this beer is overated, i say thats bullshit, its a goal of mine to try this stuff at the source."
"Great color and fruity aroma.  This is a good pilsner with a a nice hoppy finish that lingers slightly.  The bitterness is hard to describe, though not unpleasant.  Holds up well with food."
"draft in asheville- have drank this alot just never rated it until i realized i hadnt.  this is not bad, it definately lacks in some aspects- it has a weird flavor that i cant really describe- BUT it is a great summer time beer when you are hot as hell.  all in all a good effort."
Tasty! I heard of this one through a friend and decided to give it a whirl.  Can't complain at all.
"typical lager,attractive bottle, nice balance in flavours, but i lacked the bitterness which i expected."
Nice and light color and taste. Great when its ice cold and has a little hops and a little malt flavor. Absolutely crisp as the other ratings say.  Very easy to drink a few.
"(draught) Compared to the bottled version, draught is a livelier, more mellow (maltier?) drink. The hops are much further back in the mix, but with the same clarity of overall taste. A reminder of what a pleasant, easy-to-drink beer should be. As they say themselves, a benchmark."
"This has long been a light and refreshing fall-back when all there is is Eastern European lager crap. A nice golden colour with a frothy white head. Sweet malt and hops both come out in the nose. Pleasant bitterness throughout, but very mild. Have had it fresher when in Europe and it rates much higher than what I get here in Ontario. Sadly these numbers are for the less-fresh version...."
"pours with a big head tha quickly subsides. aromas are of sweet malt, saaz, maybe some peach. flavors start with astringent hop bitterness, then a slight amount of malt sweetness but it is subdued by hop flavor, and a dry bitter end. the body is light the color is a gold straw color. the beer is quite bitter and hoppy for a continental European beer. The beer is light, refreshing and what an american pilsner wishes it could be. The balance is skewed to the hoppy side, which american craft beer drinkers should love. Perhaps they would love it more with cascades in stead of saaz."
"Pillowy white head over a golden beer.  Thick lacing all the way down the glass.  Aroma is mostly floral hops but seems slightly metallic.  Some faint malt underneath that.  Taste does not seem well-balanced to me.  It is crisp enough, mildly fruity and would definately be welcome on a hot day, but otherwise nothing spectacular."
I cannot seem to get this one (and not for lack of effort) when it is fresh.  Every one I have had was skunky smelling with accompanying bitterness.
"Poured with a big white foamy head, nice looking golden beer.  Yeasty bread odor with sweet, mild fruity apple-cider smell.  Smells refreshing.  This 6-pack is not overly fresh. =\  Bitter, dry, good hop presence, some skunk(freshness issue) and a nice, mild apple//pear, lightly malty aftertaste while maintaining the bitterness.  Overall very refreshing: nice dry, bitter flavor with fruit for a very pleasant beer."
Bright gold color. White head. Strong spicy aroma very distinct. I don't find it as bitter as some seem too. A nice change from average pils but not as good as I hoped for.
"White head, golden colour. Start is sweet with a soft and smooth palate followed by a little salt&pepper-bitter finish. A very nice pilsener."
Light bitter pilsner. Very Mild. You can easily get very hammered sitting in Praha on this beer ;D
Formula 409. How is it that I've had some beers SO many times and never rated them? I would feel much worse for not really commenting so much on the beer itself (which I like) but I have looked in the past at all the ratings by the BIG PEOPLE that have NO comments at all. Formula 409
"Bottle:

Pale golden color with a creamy white head that has surprising staying power.…"
"Recommended to me by a good friend as a standard for pilsners.  Good stuff.  The aroma was pretty skunky the first time I had it, but upon more recent sampling, I found it to be quite pleasant.  The appearance was predictably light; it poured a fairly attractive pure gold shade with a medium white head and lacing. The flavor was full and hoppy, with fairly little bitterness.  Amazingly full of flavor for such a light, crisp, refreshing brew."
"Draught at U Zlateho Tygra, Praha, Czech Republic.
A large and rocky head with a malty and bready aroma.
A fine and longlasting bitterness and maltiness."
"Bought in the1 pint, 6.3 oz bottle ( green)..""Plzensky Prazdro Od 1842""..ok
This beer actually looks pretty nice for a pilsner it pours a nice clear golden colour with a large white frothy head that does shrink rapidlly but persists for a long while..
The smel is pretty average for the style..some sweet malty aromas..even a little wheat like scent..lemony.…"
"The light appearance was not the most appealing, however, the nice sweet aroma and light flavor was enjoyable under many circumstances."
Lovely pilsener; easy to find. It starts with a swet taste-aroma and ends with a - no too much- bitter tasting. Everybody needs to have Pilsner Urquell in their fridge!
"This beer pours golden yellow with a white slightly creamy head.
Aromas of corn sugar and hops. Initial sip tasted a strong flavour of corn syrup. Mouthfeel was slightly creamy. Hoppy middle with a some what bitter finish. All along with the flavour of pure corn syrup."
"Yes its better over in Czechia, but I try my luck whenever 12 packs go on sale here.   Deep golden color, noble hop aroma.    Not that bitter but w/ solid malt flavour."
"This is a very crisp beer.  Very dry, very clean.  Does have a nice grassy aroma to it.  This is a classic pils."
As largers go this is a good one. Nice zesty aroma with a nice malt and hop balance. Better than most.
"Appearance: bright golden, small head, but lots and lots of carbonation running up the glass.

smell: wheaty and very skunky. Green bottle, so there might be the answer... but this specific sample is extremely skunky.…"
"A perfect beer, very enjoyable. The color is especially golden. The taste and aftertaste are especially pleasing."
"I'm not the biggest fan of pilseners. This is a decent one. Short white slow fading head. Good ammount of carbonation throughout. Just this side of skunky apple aroma. Hoppy with some roastinesss. A bit of malt. Ricey, soil, apple and pear some honey. Round and clean."
"Hard to find this stuff in decent condition, the bottle coupled with light skunks them so fast.  Given that fact its probably hard to trust my rating as i have not had a good one.  guess i need to go to a bar in plzen."
"Bottled (660ml).  People seem to love this or hate it. I can't believe the number of comments about it being stale or skunked - how can a supposedly world class beer distributed in a such a state. Mine wasn't skunked, but I just don't find it that exciting. I'm not really a big lager fan and I don't find it a crisp as many do. There's a lot a maltiness in there. So I don't love it or hate it, I just find it unexceptional. I prefer Budvar and some other Czech pilsners. I suppose it might be different if I were drinking it fresh in a bar in Plzen, but I doubt I'll be doing that any time soon."
"Wonderful clear, golden color.  Large head which dissipates to nothing in about 2 seconds.  Clean, fresh aroma, little bit of spice/hops.  Taste is crisp and refreshing.  Mild hop bitterness.  Pleasant mouthfeel.  Not bad.  Kinda like a weak pale ale, but in a good way.  Extra points because it's a pilsner, and it's actually decent."
"I hope the drain liked this more than I did because that is where it ended up.  This beer was too carbonated, skunked, and all around nasty.  Too bad I'm not going to Czechoslovakia anytime soon to try a real Pilsner Urquell."
"my chance to sample the so called best pilsener that everyone tries to copy......and it wasn't as good as i expected. i wonder if it's because it came out of a bottle and may have been old? it looked great - golden, clear  and bubbly. the taste just wasn't there....noticed skunkiness.  i'd love to try a fresh keg of this!"
"This one is the Ashton Kutcher of beers.  People say they like it because everyone else does, but the beer itself doesn't really compare to the others.
I had it from bottles in Tennessee, and it was horrible, it got as high a rating as it did from me, because I thought maybe it had skunked.  I didn't like the taste, or the after taste...."
Good Beer. Traditional pilsner color. Nice strong aroma of a European pub. A can't go wrong selection for a spring day.
Golden color. Crisp and refreshing. Careful not to find a dusty old case that has been sitting at the distributor for a year...
"This beer is as close to perfection (for a specific style) as I can imagine IF you experience it fresh in te Czech Republic.  Even here in the states, if you get a well handeld keg, it is an awsome beer.  Ligfht straw color, delicate floral aroma from noble hops, crisp pale malt flavor with excellent mouthgfeel and clean finish - just a hint of hops in the finish.  You'll almost always find a few bottles in my fridge!"
"Pilsener Urquell is worth re-rating once every six months so...here goes:
It pours a deep golden color with a wonderful steady head. The aroma is malty and yeasty, with that Czechish saaz-nose. Flavor consists of some toffe and finishes with a pleasant dry bitterness. One of the three best Czech Pilseners I've had."
I had this in a bottle a ways back and thought it was god awful.  I gave it another go on tap and was pleasently suprised.  Has a great golden hue and a surpisingly full flavor.  Pleasently malty taste.  Goes down easy and isn't too dry.  I had to take it down a couple notches in overall due to the apparent difficulty of finding this unskunked in a bottle.
"Nice level of hops and dryness.  Enjoyed this one along San Antonio's Riverwalk.  Slight bitter aftertaste, but one that I looked forward to rather than cringed at."
"A classic beer. People who don't like this beer have gotten 'skunked' beer. My order of preference: Urquell in Czech (it is MUCH better), keged beer, and then bottles. Oh, and if you can get a tour of the brewery in Plzn in Czech Rep. then you'll taste the 'standard' of Pilsner beers. Try it and you'll like it."
"Bottle from an unexposed 12pk. at a busy warehouse store. Striking, vibrant gold color. Thin white head with a clining ring of lace. Full, rich mouthfeel that I wasn't expecting. Sweet malty aroma with a hint of flowery hops. Tastes of sweet malt and hop bitterness balance each other out without cancelling the enjoyment of each other. Fine Saaz hop flavor and aroma that can not be beat, copied or imitated by any other hop in a Pilsener. Almost seems to have a sweet orange type of fruitiness in the background. Very clean, highly drinkable beer and an untouchable Pilsener value at…"
"Still the best Boh Pils I've ever tasted.  Often skunked or stale, it's worth seeking out a good fresh, unopened case, or better yet on tap.  I attribute all poor ratings for this beer on the high frequency that it is found in poor condition.  A goal is to consistently homebrew a clone.  The other beer to have when you're not having an IPA."
"Another beer in my Beers of the World sampler.  Pale golden color, not a lot of head, but really nice hoppiness to it.  A bit of carbonation to it, as well.  A good, refreshing pilsner."
"Beautiful gold- almost light amber color.  Little head, but champagne like carbonation.  Hoppy aroma.  Flavor and palate are just OK (had this on tap once and I swear it was better than this bottle.)  Despite that, I have an overall positive impression of this pilsner due to its fantastic color, aroma, and clean ""bite"" at finish."
May be the best pilsener I have yet tasted. Nice yellow color with the right amount of corbonation. Great with spicy food.
"Pours a clear sparkling golden with a fizzy white head.  Aroma has a decent hop spice to it.  Body is lightly sweet and hoppy with a more bitter finish.  This is the standard run of the mill pilsener, but it probably tastes a lot better in the Czech Republic."
"Poured a nice Golden Yellow.Plenty of carbonation.But man,mine must have been old,cuz my wife sitting on the love seat across from the couch wondered if a skunk was outside,but it turned out to be the beer(true story!)Had a small head that quickly disappeared.Nice taste of hopps,but very bitter aftertaste that seemed like it would never go away.Thank god thw macros changed the taste of ""The Original"""
"Strong Saaz hop aroma and bitter after taste makes it difficult to finish without gulping. Clear light amber color with small head that dies quickly. Spicy hop aroma never seems to fade. Neither does the taste. Cool and crisp, this beer is countered by the low caramel taste and overpowering hop bitterness. My wife likes it, but then again."
"I have to admit, when i first heard of this beer i thought it had something to do with Urkel from that tv show.  I don't much like pilsners much to begin with.  from the pungent nose (and no, it's not skunked), to the unpleasant aftertaste that lingers like bad roadkill.  yeah, it's crisp and all, but man, it's definately not for me.  heh, maybe this beer is why my ancesters left Czech in the mid-1800's."
"So *this* is what the macros are supposed to taste like? Huh.

This is the second time I've had this pilsner. The first time was about four years ago and I thought it was nasty. It was my first time trying any foreign beers and I didn't know it could go bad. This cute little barvarian sandwich shop only carried this beer…"
"This is a great beer when it's fresh. I could do without the green bottles though. Just had one recently that was really impressive. Good firm body, enough hops to give that tasty tingle but well balanced with rich malt. This pilsner has the color of a good Munich helles...a shade or two darker than most pilsners. Nice."
"Good crisp clean beer.  Does tend to start a little skunky but never the less this good stuff.  However, I would like to try it fresh from the brewery so that it could be tasted before it has to make that long journey to the States."
"Nothing special - Straw yellow, thin and slightly sour with off flavors.  My bottle started to skunk though, so I may rerate sometime with a fresher sample."
I tried this beer because Buster Poindexter mentioned it in THE WORST BEER I'VE EVER HAD.  Great song.  OK beer.  Nothing extraordinary.  I just prefer more powerful flavor in my brew.
Classic pilsner but a little too deiicate for my tastes. Bright gold color and nice hops in the nose. Pretty good balance in this beer.
"the original pilsner, the yardstick by which to judge other pilsners, after trying this you'll realise why so many lagers dont deserve the pilsner or pils label they insist they deserve. exellently hopped and flavoured."
"Too much of a skunky aroma, and watery yellow color, but good flavor...bad aftertaste though."
to skunky tasting looks pretty piss yellow pours no head and is only good with a spicey food like thai or mexican
"Decent pilsner,but not a big fan of the style.  At least I got the original.  Number 100 baby."
"Not a lot I can add about this that hasn't been said.  I love the nice bitter finish to it.  Looks great in a glass, but I can't get used to the nose."
"I drank the unfiltered version in the brewery in Plzen. This version is actually even better, but after a visit to the brewery, i can appreciate this pilsener a lot better. Very nice strong wort aroma, hoppy also. Quite bitter taste. This beer is the best to drink before dinner, while during dinner i wouldn't prefer such a bitter pilsener."
"Just plain skunky. My cousin was able to smell its stench from across the room, no joke. Thanks to the green bottle. Must of been sitting around in the store for a while. Tastes like Corona, but skunkier. Most likely wont try this again. With my luck ill get another skunk."
The prototype for the pilsner.  Has lost some of its edge but still excells.  Beautiful golden amber color and nice head.  Mild spicy aroma.  Dry and bitter but so refreshing.  Still one of the best.
"Aroma was lacking, lightly hoppy and maybe very mildly Saaz spicy. Light green bottle so I got mine from the back of the fridge, poured a very golden yellow. Mildly spicy with a hint of malt."
"Floral-spicy nose.  Golden body with ample carbonation, billowing white head. This beer is very lightly-flavored, with soft sweetness complimented by spicy hops.  Slight papery aftertaste."
"Hey it is about time that a brewery made liquid skunk in a bottle!  What the hell is this stuff anyway, this was by far the worst pilsner that I have ever tasted!  I am not sure what everyone else was drinking, but this was nothing like the bottle said it was, nor was it like what the other ratebeerians described either.  Bottom line this was just pure czech swill.  I am sorry but nothing was good about this one."
"I have not had this beer in the US, but when I was in the Czech Republic, it was all I drank, and is apparently the favorite among the locals there.  It has a very strong hops flavor, and is quite crisp.  Just a hint of sweetness... maybe honey.  Gorgeous when poured out in a glass.  Good bitter flavor overall."
Nice middle of the road pils.Some almost clean saaz character with a touch of honey.This was sampled from a fresh enclosed 12-pk.
"One of the darkest Pilseneres I have seen.
Very, very hoppy, too hoppy for my taste actually. Otherwise nice brew."
"We'd all be rich men if we got a dime for every occasion when a lager is called golden. This stuff is golden. Not straw, yellow or what have you, but golden! The head could hold up better, but there's a bit of lacing. With that colour and initial head I can't bring me to a lower appearance score.…"
"Luckily, mine was not skunked. A good crisp pilsener that is a little bit light in the malt department and focuses mostly on the hops. Hops lend some citric/minty/herbal/medicinal qualities to the beer. Bitter, and the dryness will linger long after the beer is finished."
"Not as good as I was expecting, I like my pilsener's but maybe this bottle slightly off cos I was expecting a little bit more. Golden colour, small non lasting head, malty initial taste with not much bite. Managed to finish it at least!"
"Looks wonderful, but that's about all it has going for it. Smells and tastes like it's been sitting in the store for a year under those damn flourescent lights in it's cursed green bottle. From the other reviews it seems this is fairly common, perhaps even the way it is supposed to be. If that's true, I can't imagine how any of it gets sold. I'll take a nice malty Helles that tastes fresh and smooth, thank you very much."
"Pale yellow.  This beer is great because I love pilsner.  Nice skunky taste, made my roommate say ""damn, thats skunky shit"""
(Draught)  Pours a pale yellow  with a small white head.  Good Bohemian pilsner taste in this brew.
Draft at the Beer Sellar in Knoxville. Everyone said this tasted the way it should. Not much of an aroma. Pale yellow color with hardly any head. Not much of a beginning taste but it seemed to be a bitter. Bad aftertaste. This had to be a bad keg even though the owner said that's how it was suppose to taste. Definitely the worst Pilsner I've had.
"I really liked this beer.  The hops and malts were balanced nicely, with a bit of spice on the finish.  Maybe I got a really good bottle because there was no skunkiness and it was just pleasant all around.  Definitely a good pilsener."
"""In its usual state in the US:  
This beer pours with an immediate aroma of skunk.  A deep golden clear color, that is topped by a white head.  The taste is not as skunked as the aroma.  There is a maltiness to this beer.  It finishes with a slight bitterness, and seems a bit thin in the body.  The Saaz flavor is fairly muted at this point.…"
"The 'original' pilsner.  Very hoppy, a bit metallic with a dark golden colour and a lovely head. cheers"
Bottle. Golden color with a slightly skunky aroma (no comment on the color green). A little malty sweetness and then a spicey hop presence that lingers. More flavor than the Budvar and a bit more body. Finishes dry with a slight fruity flavor.
"Watery with no head out of bottle. It has a hoppy presense. Its not awful but its not great either. In one word, Average."
Great pilsener..nice dark yellow color and crisp taste.  goes good with bbq meat.
Smells like a pilsner and tastes like one too. I'm not a fan of the style but I'm man enough to admit that this is one of the better pilsners I've had. The aroma is only slightly grasslike and the color is typical. The flavor is fairly bland with a not-so-nice aftertaste. Kidna mediocre but still a decent pilsner.
"Smells very much like a pilsner. Thin yellow color, white head, pretty standard. The flavor is a bit skunky, bitter, and it comes with a bad aftertaste."
"This beer sucks in bottles IMHO. On tap however, I was blown away by the clean, floral, delicate flavor. I'm not a pils guy but I consider it a treat to drink this PU under the right conditions."
"Better drank in a can or from tap than in a bottle. The bottle is green and is most of the time skunked. In a can, you can smell fresh hops as you open it and poor in in a glass."
On Tap. Golden pilsner. Foamy head. Slight bitterness. The bottle is always skunked so its better to have it on tap. OK.
A quality pilsener when on tap. Pretty hoppy nose and flavor. Medium body dry and bitter finish. Beware the green bottle though.
Golden color with medium white head. Aroma is slightly hoppy but not as strong as expected.Taste is of the classic pilsner. Smooth crisp hoppy taste with a little bitterness in the finish.
Had it in a bottle. It had a hoppy aroma. Crisp and clean. The hop flavor lingers. Good beer. Pleasant.
"On tap, golden with average white head. Has a nice hop aroma, just a tad on the skunk side, but this seemed to be fresh enough. Had somewhat of a sweet malt character. Very drinkable, good pilsener now complete with a huge marketing blitz in the US. I'd take Budvar over this though."
Bottle. Hoppy aroma. Malty flavor with a good hop bite. Hop flavor lingers. Good lawnmower beer.
Clear light golden color with a foamy white head.  Smells like a pilsner should - crisp aroma of light floral hops.  Tastes slightly sweet and refreshing.  Aftertaste is slightly bitter and slightly metallic .  A solid offering of this style - but I have come to prefer more robust styles than pilsener.
"Draught, 0.5 L glass. Poured with far too much carbondioxide which makes the head disappear much too fast. Also has a bad influence on the mouthfeel. Improves considerably after some time in the glass, however should rerate bottled version."
"crystal clear (i can read through it!) straw color with a thin spongy head.  lots of bubbles, and a balanced, floral aroma (saaz maybe?).  a semi-sweet taste with good mouthfeel and a solid body, and a slightly bitter finish/aftertaste (not a bad thing, though).  nothing too complex here, but could definitely be a session beer.  very clean, overall not bad!"
"quite mediocre, nothing too exciting, thin head, medium carbonation, and the nose was typical of that of a pilsner. For a while pilsner was my favorite style, but anymore I just cant get into them. Easily drinkable with a nice aftertaste, somewhat sweet but slightly hoppy, maybe. quite refreshing."
"On tap.  This was served way too cold, but once it warmed up it had the good spice flavor that is prevalent among good pilsners."
Not a bad beer. It is possibly the best pilsner I have ever tried. The aroma is very pleasant and the flavor has a nice bitter bite to it.
"re-rate because of speeling errors.
 Had a very good flavour that was not too bitter and not watered down. Had a lightly golden body and a long lasting white head."
"Pilsner Urquell has become my number one favorite pilsner. When poured just right it has a nice eggshell white head of medium size bubbles that last quite a while and a clean golden color that looks very refreshing. After drinking this beer I now understand what all of the ""pilsner style"" beers are shooting for. Although it is lacking in the aroma department the taste is clean with a slightly bitter hops flavor and an overall sweetness that my wife said reminded her of a wine cooler. This is definitely a good choice on a hot summer day but the price is a little bit steep. I picked up a six pack on sale for…"
"Hmmm, an interesting beer. Quite aromatic and surprisingly rich in colour. Quite a different and quite sharp and almost sweet just a little twinge of metal. I like this beer but i can sense some bad headaches the next day after a night on it due to the richness of this beer. It starts quite malty and full and fishes dry, hoppy and bitter. A great beer to start with."
"Pours golden yellow with some white head that is gone in moments.  Malt nose, some muskiness (damn green bottle) though not enough to be a bad thing. Sweet flavors welcome you and then it quickly finishes bitter. Palate is smooth. Not too bad."
"I can't believe I forgot to rate this one.  Golden color with a nice head.  Grassy, hoppy aroma.  A very hoppy taste that I'm not a fan of.  I prefer a weaker flavored pilsner, like St. Pauli Girl.  Not my favorite kind of hops."
"it was much better in the bottle than from the glass.  in the glass, it had a funky smell and a metallic aftertaste.  weird.  anyway, nice golden color.  in the bottle, i smelled a hint of cinammon.  slightly bitter but it goes down smooth."
"Very refreshing beer! Never had the opportunity to try on tap, nonetheless good bottled beer. Not as skunky as heineken,light yellow and sligthly floral aroma. No strong aftertaste."
"Excellent all round beer.  Has a great smell, clean appearance and beautiful taste, probably the best european beer I've tasted"
"Not too bad for a pilsner. A nice, refreshing beer. Possibly re-rate after I find it on tap."
"nice golden color with a white head. nose is of grassy hops. nice mellow body with good hop presence. this is a really good beer on tap, but should be avioded in bottles."
"Once upon a time this was my ""model of meter"" as well, and I´m sorry to say but during the communist era the quality was really ups and downs, but when it was at the top it WAS the model of meter."
"Surprisingly hoppy for a pilsner, this one is light and smooth, refreshing.  Not much personality, but has a slightly pronounced alcohol presence."
"The wonderful hop aroma made my mouth water. It is a beautiful, rich golden beer with a nice head. It has a very clean crisp taste and finish, yet the malt is still evident but very well balanced with the hops. This is a fantastic beer when fresh."
"Clear golden with a thick-long-lasting foamy white head. Fresh saaz hop aroma (like a summer breeze); butter, flowers and minerals. Flavour is buttery and flowery with some notes of toffee. Nice flowery bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel."
Clear straw colour with minimal carbonation? Short-medium sudsy head. Dominant saaz hop aroma with a hint of sweet caramel/malt. Initial sweet caramel flavour followed by decent amount of bitterness. Saaz flavour and aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel.
Nicely hopped but other flavours are subdued. Smooth body with some cookie and caramel notes. The original...but there are better ones out there...
"Okay, okay, I was surprised.  I ventured timidly into the realm of the pilsener.  It was medium-bodied and extremely clean.  The bitterness was not what I expected-it didn't screw up my face, but complemented the overall taste very nicely.  Well-done.  I am impressed."
"Ah my favorite pilsner. Great golden color with a clean after taste.  I love the hops used in this beer they are some of the best hops on earth. When at the store ask the salesperson for a 6-pack still in the cardboard box, the green bottles, if sitting out to long make the beer skunky.  If you ever find yourself in the Czech Rep this beer goes for about 50 cents for a pint.  A tour of the brewry though gets you no free samples"
Has a nice golden color with not much carbonation and a slightly hopped smell.  Taste is slightly skunked and finishes slightly bitter.  Overall a pretty poor pilsner.
Not the best beer I've tried but decent nonetheless. The price puts me off buying it regularly but every now and then I'll buy one.
"Nice golden color with a white head, that could have lasted a little longer. The taste is malts with a nice full hoppy finish."
This beer is the perfect example of why I don't like pilsners.  Transparent; light in color; crisp flavor with a slightly rubbery aftertaste; and almost alcohol-free (only 4.4%).  Makes a good mouthwash.
"I like so many others got burnt with my first 6pack, as Pepi LaPhew must have sat in it. The 2nd one was much better. Dark golden color, quick disappearing head, slightly hoppy aroma,Soft but full satisfying taste and aftertaste. Crisp, simply one step up from the American commercial brews. Problem is, how do you recommend it to someone when there's at least a 40% chance they'll be skunked"
"Skunky, I will try this on tap and buy another bottle to see. Bitter aftertaste."
"the only complaint i'd say would be the occasional skunk bottles you get.  but other than that a great pilsner, definitly one of my fav. beers.  always good going down."
"Pretty good. Pale color with OK head and no lacing. Typical Pils, only OK. Nice initial taste and a decent finish. Not bad."
"The head was small sized, white and contained fine-small bubbles that quickly dissipated.The body was carbonated and clear.The hue was gold.The nose was skunky and there was no lacing with this beer.The flavor was bitter tasting and it left an aftertaste.The mouthfeel was thin and watery."
"Hoppy, skunky, but somehow appealing. Not much on the aroma, decent head, slightly bitter, but light and refreshing."
"This is the true ""skunky"" beer.  Somewhat simi9lar to Heine, Becks, and the others. Not spectacular yet not shitty either. The 6 pack price is a bit hefty, try to find stores that sell these individually."
"Overall, a wonderful brew. Strong golden color with a well-balanced hop-malt combination. Although, I think Czechvar edges it out just a little."
"Supposedly, this Czech beer is the world's oldest pilsner. I didn't like it at all.  Skunky taste.  Highly overrated, if you ask me."
"This is what a beer should be, great aroma, flavor packed, slightly bitter after taste. Those Czech's know how to do it"
"This beer packs a punch! Massive Saaz Hops aroma,clean fresh malty taste.Plenty of Hops flavour and deep long hops finish.Best Pilsner available."
"Rich gold color with a thick long lasting head. Spicy hop and sweet malt aroma. Medium bodied, dryish and tangy, with distinct malt and hop flavors that intertwine wonderfully. The finish is smooth and slightly bitter, and this was one fine glass of beer. Like a lot of people, I have been frustrated by the inconsistency of this renowned brew, but the skunk is out of town this time. 12 bottles packed in a cardboard container, so being exposed to light was not an issue here."
"Aroma is floral and slighty strong, appearance is typical yellow/golden color. Flavor is crisp with a citrusy and grassy undertone. The bitterness hits you after the initial tasting and it lingers on your tounge. I feared green bottle skunk but mine tastes fine, perhaps I just got lucky in that repsect. Good beer and I liked it a little better than Victory Pils although it was very good also."
"Color is golden yellow with some carbination and the head sits comfortably at three fingers high with a small bubbly and bumpy, foamy head. Smells is kind a blah, nothing much but some floral hop aroma thats very faint. Taste is equally a nice soft malt with a floral hop thats somewhat spicy and bitter dry. Feels like most pilsners, a bit soft, clean, dry, and smooth and quite a good quencher."
"A good pilsner beer.  I prefer a ""lighter"" beer in the summer.  This is a quality beer that can be consumed in a good quantity also!  If you want to know specifically how it tastes or looks read one of the ratings below!"
"Toronto Festival of Beer 2001 - Nyeh... Never really been impressed with the can version of this. It's a good pilsener, but not one of my favorite beers generally. It's too bad they didn't have it on draft, since I have never tried it on tap. I think Pilsener is just not a style of beer I am a fan of generally."
"Dark gold color with a medium white head, rapidly diminishing.  Hoppy nose and an inviting aroma.  Medium bodierd, crisp and refreshing. Bitter hoppy finish but with enough malt backbone to provide balance.  Good beer."
"I think that I keep getting bad bottles of the stuff, its always skunky. Despite that fact it is a clean and refreshing beer with a good hop bite. Need to try on tap."
"It is a quality pils. The bitterness seemed off, I likely had an old can. I did go for the can though knowing how much freshness can effect this beer. Still I wasn't too impressed."
"golden in color, decent head with lacing, flowery aroma. Excellent hoppy bitter flavor and finish."
"The original. What more need you say! Wonderful aroma of Saaz hops, good medium body. Flavor is hops and clean pale malt, with wonderful undertones of darker malt (munich? Vienna?). Saaz hop finish leaves you satiated, but ready for more."
"Dark golden color with a thin head that faded fast but left some lacing. The aroma was  malty with some fruity  overtones.  The taste was malty and slightly hoppy, though  there was touch of soapiness in the aftertaste which I did not particularly care for. Not a bad beer, just not a very interesting one. It's better than the average American Pilsner, but that's not saying much."
Light golden color with a small amount of head.  Great clean crisp taste with a  slight hops aftertaste.  A fine an enjoyable pilsener.
"Straw hue with small head and some lacing, thin bodied. Saaz aroma, grassy and lighty fruity. Nice crisp and clean taste and mouthfeel. The aroma and taste is a constant reminder of my first encounter with Euro lager as a young man. Still among the finest of it genre."
"12 oz green bottle, pours deep golden color with a nice white head that clings to the sides of the glass. Good fresh grassy hop aromas, nice clean grainy hoppy flavor, medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel, finishes dry and clean, awesome pilsner, the way it should be."
"light malty aroma. Pours a golden brown, nice creamy head. Creamy malt presence. Fruitiness and hops in the flavour. Quite hoppy actually. Satisfying aftertaste and quite refreshing."
"6/21/03, bottle, Berlin.  I'm not a pilsner fan, but this is a good one.  Golden amber color, thick white head leaving magnificent lacing.  Characteristic pils aroma with beautiful balance to the smooth malts and spicy hops.  Complex flavors,  malts and citrus hops.  Soft palate, medium body giving way to assertive carbonation."
I don't think this was too fresh. It almost tasted skunky.  Had a plesant bitterness but there were many undesired off flavors present. Overall not too bad. Hopefully I will be able to try one that is a little more fresh next time.
"Golden body. Light hop aroma, with a slight skunkiness. Light saaz flavor, good balance. I think this one wasnt too fresh, so it was a bit skunked."
"Best pilsener I've had; take that for what it's worth. Not bad at all, super clean and crisp. Just a touch skunky. Very interesting, if nothing else."
"Promises much and delivers most of it.  This can be fantastic and can also be rubbish.  It is clearly very effected by the draught system used and I have drunk this thinking it was crap and I have also had this marvelling at the complexity and clarity.  Still, I am not a lager fan at all but this is one of the best no doubt.  Great with fish.  This is a real mood beer.  Hot day, tight bikini's, scorching sun ... nothing better."
"Upon opening, I smelled a certain striped desecrator of flavor on the nose.  We all know, however, that drinking beer is about ""image,"" and this ""foreign-looking"" green bottle is preferred by the trendy and sophisticated swillers of the world, apparently.  Luckily, light hops restored their aromatic dominance (although they weren't exactly dominant), and the golden-colored body is flavorful, hitting the tongue with slightly spicy hops upon sipping, and opening to sweet, smooth malt and lemon flavors upon the swallow.  From what I've read about this beer, I believe I escaped the brunt of…"
As a pilsner its fine. As a beer it's average.Taste is clean but I thought it was too dry. Not worth the price unless you are a die-hard pilsner fan.
"[bottle] The perfect beer glass: clear, shiny golden color, medium carbonation, and a nice, lasting white head. The aroma is herbal and hoppy, but disappointingly faint. Taste is crisp, clean and dry. Light and drinkable without being too thin, and flavourful enough to satisfy your palate with just the perfect amount of Saaz bitterness."
An excellent Pilsner beer. Such a sin it costs as much as it does because I could drink one of these all day long.
I was introduced to this wonderful beer about fifteen years ago and am very pleased to find it growing in popularity.  It has become one of my standards.
"RERATE: Nice deep amber in color, minimal head/lacing. Skunky funky smell.
OLD: Had some from draft last night. Not nearly as good as bottled samples I fondly recall, so these ratings reflect an average of the two experiences. Draft was amazingly not nearly as good as bottled memories. Tart aftertaste, decent sense of maltiness. I used to really really like this beer a lot, but now, I'm not selling the farm for it."
"I have sampled bot the American version and the Non imported.This is a rating of the non imported.The pils poured clean with a small head.The flavor had more body than its american version.The finish had some bitterness to it , but overall this is much better than what i had before."
"On Tap- Rich O's New Albany, Indiana. Golden color, nice white fluffy head which dissipates quickly. Light aroma of hops and malt. Goes down well. Crisp, clean, refreshing."
"The Original, a great change in beers, but I believe others out there have beaten the orignal on taste and flavor.  But heck, this was the first Pilsener, so it deserves some respect.  But I don't like it."
"Very light golden color. Extremely clear. Lots of tiny bubbles dancing their way to the top. Solid bright white head. Pleasant hop smell pronounced but not overpowering - just right for the style. On entry, again very dry and somewhat thin and crisp. Nice hop finish running dry rather floral - appropriate for the style. This is a refreshing, drinkable beer. I prefer bottle conditioned ales,but this is among the very best regardless of style. This is what Light American Lagers should taste like."
a pretty damn good beer.  i enjoyed 2 6 packs and some pretzels one night while watching a ball game and look forward to doing it more often with this stuff
"Aroam is feakin good , pilsner like :) .Soft ,nice biterr , lots of hops . Good beer."
"Pale golden, good carbonation. Wonderful clean, fresh, hoppy aroma. Flavor is light and crisp, with a nice richness, fairly malty and well balanced with perfect dry finish."
This is how all Pilsners should taste and act.  It pours out beautifully and has an increadable aroma.  The combination of hops and malt are exceptional to the nose.  It has tremendous mouth feel as it gets past the lips and leaves a flavour that lets you know it is a true pilsner.  I often think I am in the Chech republick when I drink it.
"22 oz. Green bomber bottle. No freshness date that I can see. Pours out a bright sunshine yellow color. Decent, but short lived head. Faded to a slight island of thin foam in the middle of the glass. Very effervescent, almost champagne like. Aromas of fresh malts, fresh mown hay, and noble hops. Crisp, refreshing, easy to drink. Kind of thin on the palate, but it's supposed to be. Very well balanced, finishes bright, clean, and crisp. A really good beer in my book."
"looks good, however most bottles tend to be skunky, so i always consider buying it a risk. Although, im still very curious how it tastes on tap."
"Lucky me, I landed a fresh bottle for this rating.  Aroma is nice, the faintest skunk, but appropriate for the style, mostly hops on the nose.  Poured with a nice white head, which has remained slight but present throughout.  Beautiful lacing on the glass, as even a bad bottle of Pilsner Urquell will do. Good palate, very good taste, balanced but a nice spring garden burst of hops that lingers long after swallowing.  I had this once as the first pour from a new keg at a new restaurant.  It was so fresh as to nearly bring a tear to my eye.  This is a good bottle, but it just can't stand up to a fresh draught.  I…"
"A true classic. Massive Saaz hop nose, beautiful round malt palate, 40 IBU's. Thirst quenching and satisfying. When it is fresh (very important in this beer's case)it is my ideal pale lager."
"Clean, Crisp and clear.  Litle or no complexity - simple to figure out but difficult to duplicate."
"The bartender at a resort in Scottsdale recommended this a few months ago so I tried it.  It was draft and was extremely good.  I bought a 6-pack of bottles a little later, and it didn't even seem like the same beer, tasted like all the other European green bottled skunks.  Very disappointing, but I have fond memories of the draft."
"The classic pilsner. Unfortunately there is a wide variety of final product here in the states. Whether it is the green glass, or how it is shipped, etc... is open to debate. One thing that can't be debated is that when this beer is on, it is a great drinking pilsner. Luckily the bottle I had recently was on. Nice bubbles, dark light straw in color. Big then fading white head. Sweet malt flavors mix well with the great hops to produce a nice, drinkable beer."
"Bottled. Golden with a fine, steady white head. Initial strong hop aroma escaping the bottle, then it settles down to be less exciting. Not masses of flavour, smooth slight hop that transitions into bitter, then slightly tart flavour. Smooth consistent palate. No surprises.  There are plenty of Czech beers better then this mass market one."
Blah.  Like strangely alcoholic iced tea.  Not at all what I want in a beer.  Tasted skunky.
"Light gold color, small lingering head. Malty, some sweetness, good deal of carbonation (not too much, but close), overall fairly tasty."
"The first pilsener ever made and certainly one of the best.  Pours a beautiful head with tons of lace, floral aroma and a nice hop finish."
"Out of the bottle, this beer can be hit & miss due to the green glass skunk action. Thankfully, it's easily available in cans here in Ontario, and we can therefore enjoy it in a relatively fresh form, where it is a top-notch, world-class beer. Vibrant golden colour with a strong white head, floral hops on the nose, soft and full flavour with sweet malt and a perfectly bitter finish. Beautiful."
"A delicious beer! This is a good pilsner, awesome example of the Bohemian brewing arts. Ahh, thos Saaz hops! Dry, finish. I generally prefer Belgian ales and stouts, but this is a damn fine beer!"
"Draft - I had this on draft at an Orioles game.  I do not care for this beer in bottles in the States because it has a skunky aroma.  On draft in the US it seems to be much fresher.  I'm rating this mostly on past experience with the beer because I have had it several times in Europe, including Prague, and there it is the best Pilsner available.  Tons of aroma.  Great bitter flavor.  When fresh, an exceptional Pilsner beer."
"Aroma is a little bit weird, but the flavor is great!  Crisp, clean taste.  I'd have it again in a heartbeat."
"I tried this from a 22 oz bottle on the train home, alte at night, suffering from a cold. That said, it made a really good impression. Nice little head formed in the bottle, and a really sharp Saaz hop bite I would never have expected in a pale lager. Really helped ease my suffering; and bless the 7-11 on Michigan Ave. for having a variety of beer to take home besides the usual 40's of malt liquor and Foster's oil cans!"
"This is not a bad pilsner, but it's very bitter.  It has a very strong wheat content in the taste also.  I really don't like this beer too much."
"Too much bitterness for me. They say that this is The Mother of all Pilsner, but I still don't like it."
"Foamy head on pouring, almost completely diminishing but pleanty of large to very fine bubbles raise from the bottom of the glass. Deep colden color. Nose is hoppy with a slight malty undercurrent. Initially the flavor is semi-sweet, doughy, almoast toasty malt with only a slight touch of hops. The magic is how the balance of flavors changes with each sip. The hops are at first subdued, barely there, just some saaz spiceyness around the edges. The hop flavor increases throughout, never quite overpowering the malt. Moderate but feisty carbonation helps breath life into this medium bodied brew.…"
"Never had a Czech beer before, but if this is exemplary of them all then I'm impressed."
The Original Pilsener.  A great beer if you can find a fresh one.  Mine was skunked out.  Good flavor and crispness despite the damage the light had done.  I am still searching for a good one.
"This beer is considered by many beer lovers the finest beer in the world and I agree 100%. It has a very nice hoppy aroma, and the taste is even better. It is easy to dirnk and easy to swallow. It's bitter taste is that of fine zaas hops, the best of their kind. It gives you a nice hoppy, somewhat fruity aftertaste, the same taste as when you drink the first sip, even when it warms up a little bit after sitting around. It is better enjoyed when you swallow it slow to unlock that unmatched hoppy taste that stays on your mouth for a while. This is the only true and original pilsner beer and is the most…"
"A great beer! Hoppy and full bodied, wellbalanced bitterness, with a nice caramel after taste. Almost amber im colour, with a golden head."
"The aroma of this beer announces is special flair.  Full flavor is foreshadowed upon opening the bottle.  The color is a muted golden, and the flavor is pleasantly piercing at the middle of the tongue and also at the back of the throat.  A special beer experience"
"Urquell is the best pilsner that I have had to this day. It is a magnificent sparkling beer. Moderately light in taste, exceptionally crisp, I like it with Mexican food, worth every cent. ENJOY"""
"Quickly diminishing head.  Fair amount of carbonation.  Slightly copperish hue.  Approaching strong aroma, a little hoppy, sort of metallic.  Lingering after taste, sort of metallic, as well.  Overall, not bad, with high availability and all."
"Smelled skunky from the moment the cap was loosened.  Mild smell of hops, and malt undertones.  Flavor is rather ho hum, has some decent hop characteristics, and a slight malty aftertaste."
Mild hoppy aromas and a bit lacking on maltier qualities. Nice dark gold coloring. Crisp finish. Only a little funky but this is not a consistent quality of each batch.
"I have not noticed consistency problems in the bottles. I have drunk many, many of bottles of it too.  For the past two years it's been really cheap for some reason at my neighborhood liquor store.  It's nice on tap too, although i've never had it at the source.  My hands down favorite campfire beer, especially since they stopped putting the foil so far up the neck of the bottle."
"This Bohemian beauty is in fact the first Pilsner made (from the town of Plzen). Flowery start, bitter finish. Nice Golden head."
"darker than most pilsners. Has a bit of a bit for a light beer.  I poured it from a can and the head disapeared quite fast.  slight skunky smell, but it's not in the taste.  Good beer, I'd love to have a pint from the tap someday."
Good for a pilsner. Hoppy bitterness with malted undertones. Good appearence with an above average flavor.
"I had it on draft.  Man, I hate this style of beer from the blah opening to the minty aftertaste.  I'll leave more for everyone else."
Okay light beer with just a little bit of eau de skunk.  It had a good head and a nice aroma.
"Very, very tasty beer.  Good aroma.  Nice, darker than a normal pilsner, colored beer.  The best light beer I have ever had."
"This is pretty good. Great Head. Flavor is  a bit dry, but sometimes that's good. Nice beer with a very slight bite at the end. Definitely a keeper."
So this is the first pilsner ever made. Smells fruity and skunky. Doesn't taste as skunky as you would think.
"Poured a clear golden yellow with a thick white head. Light floral hop aroma with a faint spicy zing. Light hop flavor with a lightly sweet malt background and bitter aftertaste of hops. Clean, dry with a light mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Not nearly as good as the stuff closer to the source."
"For something that pours like water, Pilsener Urquell really has a pleasant taste."
"Fine aroma of hops, golden, large cream coloured head, with faint lace. Great hops taste, some malt but such a nice bitter aftertaste. Well balanced, good body, dry bitter finish. A truly great Pilsner, first had this in 1972, still reliably good!"
Dry bitter finish. Having one just makes you thirstier. Isn't that the way it should be?
"Very little in the way of aroma, but with a nice reddish gold color.  The only really remarkable thing about this beer was the rapidly evolving flavor that pops out of the esters.  I've never tasted anything like it.  It's fruity in a way I can't place.  After the initial hit, the otherwise normal beer just fleshes out into this really remarkable flavor that only lasts for a few seconds.  The strong spike in taste leaves a fairly unpleasant aftertaste behind."
"True to style, since it is the style, but this is a style that i just dont appreciate as much as others.  the aroma was malty with spicy hop accents and a touch of diacetyl at the end.  the brilliantly clear body is golden and supports a creamy white head.  there is a malty flavor that starts and then returns in the finish but its continuity is interrupted by noble hop flavoring and bitterness.  the balance in the finish is quite refreshing.  the medium carbonation and body make this a quaffable drink."
"The first pilsner and still one of the best. Good clean appearance, golden colour, bubbly foam, not really lasting. The aroma is very hoppy, with some floreal notes. Some malty sweetness in the taste, but the main quality of this beer is the aftertaste: pleasanty bitter dominated by the great flavour of Saaz hops. This beer gives its best on tap or in big bottles (finally I've found 66 cl bottles!)."
This is by far the best pilsner I've had so far.  Yellowish-gold color with little head.  Everything is nicely balanced to make a smooth drinking beer.
"nice deep gold color, moderately but pleasantly bitter, long-lasting, classic Pilsner taste"
A really good crisp beer. It sure tastes good with pizza or calzone. This beer was the beer of the month at a bar around the corner.
A medium golden color with a light head. Lightly bitter. A perfect pilsner.
"green bottle = skunky, (although being a former heineken addict, i don't mind it that much) poured with a nice foamy head but it dissappeared before I could take a sip, light amber/orangish like color, crisp taste, thats all I can say really, slight hoppy finish, Pilsners aren't really my thing"
Very tasty beer. Aromatics are excellent! Nice hoppy touch too. I will definitely buy this beer again.
A beer with many traditions. I like its bitterness - a perfect beer for a hot summerday
"A golden clear and sparkly appearance with a very dispersed head. A slight skunky and fruity flavor...crisp. I don't really dig pilsners...but, it wasn't undrinkable."
"what can i say-saaz hops all the way!!!  had on tap about a week ago and i must say, a very respectful pilsner."
"I'm not much into Pils but this one is quite nice.  A lot of flavour in this darker pilsner.
Almost a floral like taste.  Nice bite in the finish.  Sure beats the other pilsners I've had."
"Has to be one of the best overall pilsners in the world. Perfect, good sized head. Flavour is wonderful."
"Very bitter afterbite, kind of surprising for even a pilsner I thought.  Perhaps it is because I drank it after another very bitter beer..."
"This is one of the best pilseners.  It's better than SAB's other ""true pilsener beer"" (Miller Lite)."
"Somehow this seems a shadow of the Pilsner Urquel I drank draft in Berlin; did they Americanize it?  A deep rich clear amber golden color.  Nose of dry floral hop and a little malt.  I would have liked more malt and more bitter hop in the taste.  Mouth is about right for a lager or pilsner, balanced, with spritz and bite.  Drinkable, no flaws, no major excitement."
I'm not a big fan of pilsner beers but this Bohemian brew sits o.k. with me.
Deep yellow gold with a medium body and bitterness. Rich malty aromas are well complemented by tangy hop notes. Very flavorful and stylish. Great balance and substance.
"I just don't like pilsner's, but this is probably as good as they come. Very hoppy in both taste and aroma, although I wasn't that thrilled with the aroma. Beautiful light golden color.  I'm a dark beer man, so I'm going to stay away from these in the future, but if pilsner's are your thing this is probably the best way to go."
"the perfect sunflower golden color as depicted in classic vintage beer ads.  a hard pour will set off a fountain of tiny carbonated jewels in perfectly choreographed ascending single-file lines hurrying upward to fortify a lofty city of foam . pretty as hell.  in 30 years of energetic drinking, i've  run about a thousand gallons of p.u. through my system, and i've long accepted it's varying degrees of freshness and it's occassionally compromised aroma: that ""light-touched"", earthy musk smell we associate with certain black and white members of the weasel family and to green bottled beers. back in…"
Pale golden pilsner. Decent head. Clean light taste with a nice hop finish.
"White and fast diseappearing head. Deep golden color. Aroma is hoppy with herbal and malty notes. Flavor is hoppy with crispy tones (rice) and with a strong malty fragrance, ending in a bitter pleasant finish. Light bodied."
"Man I love this easily obtainable beer !
This is getting back to the basics if you've been all wrapped up in this currently trendy ""i only drink Belgian beer"" trip ..
Great subtle sweetness in a lightish, goes with every food kind of brewski .…"
"I would not drink this out of the bottle, I have had bad luck every time I have.  But I must say it is a wonderful thing to drink on tap."
"A pretty good pilsner, though not my overall favorite.  Still, you can do worse.  Although I have to say the few times I have had it, it seemed to taste a bit different on the bitterness balance each time around, so you need to be a bit wary of this one."
"On tap: Colour is close to bronze, not much in the nose, but the flavour made up for it: great piney hops, with citrus and malt in the background. . . I not a huge fan of pilsners, but this was a great glass."
"This beer was a touch skunky when I tried it out of the bottle. I went down well, but not exactly my favorite style. It definitely wasn't terrible and was very refreshing. Good beer all around."
"Pours a light golden color with a persistent, white head.  The aroma is not spectacular, yet pleasant and complete.  It's fairly bitter, with plenty of hops atop the the matly base.  Still not my favorite style, but probably my favorite within the style.  Easy drinking and it seems like it would be great on a hot summer day."
Good beer just not my thing.  Great on tap..................................
"Deeper golden than some pilsners & I immediately notice the aroma, bigger nose than most I've tried lately. Subtle hop and a stronger malt fragrance. Virtually no head, though bubbly. A little lemon, rounder feel in the mouth. This is definately an easy drinker! Very refreshing! Too bad it's kinda expensive.  Gotta catch it on sale."
"The aroma was a bit skunky, with hints of herbs and hops ( I kinda like the smell of skunky beers).  The appearance is a brassy gold, with a bubbly head.  The flavor was initially bitter, but yet ends smooth, with maybe a slight hint of licorice, or maybe very light fruit.  The beer is smooth and drinkable.  Overall a nice beer."
"had a general lager/pilsner flavor, maybe a little flavorful than a normal lager, but had a skunky finish that I could not forgive.  Would drink again but never buy."
Certainly one of the best pilsners I have tasted............................
Tap: Golden color with white head.Light herbal hop nose.Light malt flavor with notes of (apple?) and a dry finish
"The best pilsner I have had to this point.  Very refreshing in the summer, good clean bitterness at the end, but not like many German pilsner.  Much better balance.  A fine beer."
Good decent beer... One of the better ones I have had lately.. Taste and Flavour is well represented here.
"A nice clean pilser.  I tried this in a somewhat smoke filled bar, so I''ll have to rerate once I try it again."
"I finally got to try this on tap in Atlanta; I've been scared away by the green bottles and horror stories of skunky filth.  Anyway, I found it to have a bright Saaz aroma, clean malt bite, and an appetizing hoppy bitterness.  Not quite life changing, but it lived up to my expectations and maybe even to its reputation."
"This one did not impress me.I found it to be quite bitter and have a strong after taste. Although I''d drink it again, it won''t be my first choice."
"I decided to try this on New Year''s Eve b/c it was on sale.  Tasted good, and chased Jager shots very well."
"Tried a pint last night, and it was excellent.  Definately one of the top pilseners that I''ve tried."
...........................................................................
A classic. Complex and challenging for a lager..............................
"Really skunky taste. Looked good,nice color.good head.Will try this one again and will probably rerate then. Only had one."
"Golden color, creamy head. Sweet aroma. Some malty flavours but aroma hops are dominating. This ""original"" pilsner is not very dry or herbal. Medium body. Surprisingly full flavoured for the amount of alcohol. Very drinkable. Unfortunately pasteurized."
"Bottle. Light amber, apple-cider color. Tastes warm even from the fridge. Lots of action in the 
mouth. Mild musty smell with a rusty, oxidated taste. Sweetish and tart. Not a knock-out,
because it is a pilsner, but at good one at that. Not much to say for or against this…"
"This was quite good, especially for a pilsner.  I''m glad a pilsner buddy made me try it, I''ll probably have this again a few times."
"On tap here in America.  Seems like a good idea to me.  Less likely to be monthss old.  Dark golden color, with hints of amber.  Crystal clear body, much darker that I expected.  Very light, crisp malts, mildly hopped.  Real clean!  Smells like some cereal grain is in there too.  Wow, lots ot barley And grainy taste.  Kind of fizzy, but that should be expected, I suppose.  Mild notes of subdued hops on the sides of the tongue.  Certainly deserves It''s reign as the ""gold standard"" for a pilsener!"
...........................................................................
Bottled(500ml). -for me Budweiser is better.................................
"nice golden color, very crisp, but slightly bitter. it is a very refreshing beer."
"simple:pilsner urquell ;all pilsners are compaired to this pilsner.taste of hops perfect.head medium, adds to taste.golden,perfect beer."
"aroma is a bit off at first. head retention poor. i prefer the hoppier german interpretations of the style better. with that said, the overall flavor grew on me and the soft malt finish kept me gulping more. not bad overall and priced well at this time- $5.99 per six and $10.99 per 12 at Osco."
"Plenty of head, dark golden pilsner like color. As the bottle says, it's the original pilsner. The one all are based off of. Aroma was skunky as expected from a green bottle import that had no doubt been on the shelf for a while. Oakes is probably right that if this beer were fresh, it would be superb. The palate on this beer was not very fulfilling to me. Left an empty dry feeling in my mouth with a metallic finish. This beer's flavor was very full. Lots to be found in this beer, unfortunately, most of it was covered up by the skunky taste. Overall a very drinkable pilsner that I will consider in the…"
"A good pilsener, but not near the equal of Budvar (Czechvar). This one's ranking is largely predicated by reputation. Lacks the subtle complexities of Budvar. Pours a cider color with a small, rapidly dissipating head. Flavor is a bit too ""grainy;"" not malt flavors exactly but a bit like Wheat Chex. Upon first opening it smells a bit like a certain leafy illicit substance. Nice finish."
"After i saw TV commercials, expectations were high. But the beer itself is nothing special."
"Another re-rate for this beer. Previous 3.8 and 4.0. Great looking rich golden brew with nice thick head. Very refreshing, some sweetness of light roasted malt with great smooth but with bite bitterness. Super fun to drink, well made pilsner. Great from start to the end ."
"Nice but not great.  Always see it listed on top of pilsner lists--- guess I''m not a pils expert, I don''t taste much difference between it and DAB."
I love this beer.I see alot of you have got skunky stale ones.I have never had this experience.a strong Saaz hop taste.very crisp and aromatic.a very good beer.
A wonderfully strong colour and smooth soothing flavour.  You can't stop at one demands to be drunk steadily but with respect.
the first pilsner ever..is defintely a very good beer. decent taste..easy drinking. nothing very harsh at all.
"Hear me now! Nice standard pils. Very saaz, very chill, very now. Beach kulcha never knew such Czech gangsta sensibility. Let's count down the years of love or something."
had it here in the states and in the czech...way better overseas but still disipointing to how much it was hyped
"You''ll probably never forget your first introduction to the aroma of Saaz hops.
Pilsner Urquell was mine.
I too have noticed inconsistency; between bottles
and kegs, kegs and kegs.  Gee, guess I''ll have to…"
"The mother of all pilseners mostly characterized by its malty sweetness followed by a long and dry hopbitter finish. Moreover, it has a nice white head and a decent lacing."
"Skunky taste. ""Thanks green bottle""! 
-This had a typical skunk smell with a mellow pilsner taste.
Not for me"
"Great pilsner.  Nothing like most of the crappy american ones.  Rich head, great hoppy bitterness and floral aroma.  Smooth and beautiful."
"This is an excellent beer that rates just a shade behind Czechvar (Budvar). Lacks that pilsner''s smoothness. Still, this is a tremendous brew. Great hoppy aroma and taste. Some grassy notes. Great palate with pleasant bitter aftertaste. Maitaining its quality while becoming more widespread in this country."
"This definatly doesn''t deserve the bad ratings i''ve seen.I''m sure there are some bad bottles out there but if you have the means keep shopping for a good one it''s worth it.It had a light head,with some hop aromacoming through crisp taste with a definate hoppiness and a clean finish well worth the money and the time to get a good bottle"
This is the first try it was in a bottle in Nova Scotia .Bad first impression not a good burp and poor aftertaste maybe it was a bad bottle .But you would think that for a company that has been brewing since 1842 would be able to eliminate so many skunky beer .I will try again at a much later date maybe when I visit the Czech Republic to get a fresh bottle .TTFN
"I picked up a bottle of this on a recommendation from a friend... well lets just say he wont be listened to anymore. The aroma is skunkier than a Heineken. Very clear, blonde appearance with hints of amber..perhaps it was just the candlelight causing that effect. The taste was very carbonated and very skunky...a bitter bite with every sip. This pilsner was nothing extraordinary at all, i was not impressed...if i wanted something like this i would have bought an MGD or a Heineken"
"This is, and always has been my favorite pilsner. Luckily for me, this beer has been selling at a local outlet for just over $6 a six pac. It has a wonderful floral aroma and has a good balance of flavors, not too bitter, but yet no too sweet. Wish I could afford this more often."
It''s very bitter ! - Just like a Pilsner has to be. Almost the best on the market... if it was not for Kulmbacher Reichelbraeu Edelherb
"Tastes a little like liquid bread.  I know I''m gonna get flamed for this,  but I actually prefer Corona.  Not a bad beer though.  I''m drinking one right now..."
Canned: This one was quite different to the first time I rated it. Medium gold clear with a medium size shortish lasting white head. Faintly yeasty wheat beer aroma. Malty cooked pasta and floral nectar on glass swirl. Thin low carb body. A lot more intense bitter and bigger sweeter maltier flavours than the previous rate. Decent hoppy clean finish. Much improved over the first rating. First time a can has rated better than a bottle.…
...........................................................................
Zatec hops flowers are unbelievable! All you need is draught Prazdroj (no bottled or canned versions).
Great golden color with a huge white head that left lace all the way down. Great saaz hops with balanced malted barley.
"For this one, I had to compare the bottled version with the can.  The first time I had this beer was in a bottle and it was totally skunked.  Fortunately my last bottle wasn''t so here it goes.  Both the bottle and can had a golden color with a quick falling head.  They had a sweet fresh cereal aroma but the can was a bit fruitier with a touch of honey.  The bottle didn''t taste really good.  It was honeyish, a bit thin with notes of wet grass and a metallic bitter finish.  The can was a lot rounder and fuller with a crisp flavor, a tad of honey and a well balanced bitterness."
"Nice golden color. well Pils is not my fav style.Fresh & light. crisp,creamy, a Pils by any other name is still a Pils, decent choice, nothing more."
Absolutely the leader in its field. Beautiful balance of Saaz hops and powerfully aromatic barley malt. The only better Pilsener you''ll ever get is the unpasteurised version from the brewery itself. Go there; it''s worth it!
"Smell is a strong, but a bit on the pungent side.  Flavor is smooth but it leaves a bit of a tang on the palate.  It looks pretty plane.  Overall it is definatly not worth the price."
"A little bitter finish, but a good tasting pilsner. Didn''t really leave me longing for more though."
THIS BEER IS A GREAT PILSNER BUT ITS DEFINTITLEY NOT SOMETHING I WOULD TRY AGAIN. IM NOT A HUGE FAN OF PILSENERS. VERY HOPPY.
"Nice sweet, malty aroma and nicely bitter, but nothing special to my taste."
The original. Enough said...................................................
"Man, mybe it was a bad bottle (there was plenty of dust build up on it), but I thought this was totally disgusting.  I'll try again when my gag reflex chills out.
Re-rate 1/8/02:  My previous rating had been made after I sampled an old, bottom of shelf, dusty ass bottle.  After sampling some on tap, my opinion has done a complete 180.  This is one of the sweetest, most satiating lagers I have ever had the pleasure of putting in my belly.  I can taste a very honey like flavor and the clarity is surpassed…"
"Just when I thought this beer had lost all its flavour, I went to the brewery and tasted it - and it was 5 times as good as out of the bottle. hugely malty, buttery, and of course, amazingly bitter and floral from the fresh hops... woah. went down extremely well with goulash and dumplings at 11am, and there's not many beers I could say that about."
"Pretty much the classic Czech pils.  Clear golden colour with tall white head.  Dry, crisp, and sazzy flavour."
"Hmm... maybe mine haven't been fresh. I am a long way from the Czech Republic. Some pepper, some extracty mineral flavors, dusty hop flavors. Could be lightstruck -- they don't see fit to package this beer appropriately. One of the most overrated beers at RateBeer."
"Medium dark gold color, medium head. Hoppy and malty. Nice floral hop flavor, good balance, only slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is full and round. Taste is smooth and full bodied. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Rich golden color.   Has a ""snappy"" dryness.   Good for drinking many in the summer.   Bitter finish.   Far superior to American macro pilsners."
Fair head but a nose akin to feet.  Sweet malty charactor and a nice floral hoppyness...but that smell???   Also noticed a little unpleasant bitterness in the back half.
"Nice hop aroma, pours a golden yellow with a large white head. I must have gotten a good bottle, because this is a tastey pilsner. Slightly bitter hop aftertaste. Hopefully I can find this on tap somewhere to compare it to the bottles. Definitely a worldclass beer."
"Along the same lines as Heineken and Becks. Pungent and skunky but judging from the overall score, dust on the bottles, and expected lack of consistancy in green bottles, they may be a little off."
A very fine example (maybe the only example) of real pilsener! A very hoppy flavour and aroma with a twist of malt. The palate is very bitter and strong and lasts for a long time. Very nice dark/golden colour. A very well balanced brew!
One of the better Pilsners..................................................
...........................................................................
"I dont know why pilsners arent higher up on the food chain here. This was a great, non abraisive food beer. Step up from Heine..."
"One of my fvourite lager/pilsener style beer.  Difficult to fault in any way - I just wish that beers of this type could score more highly on the aroma and appearance front! Lovely, refreshing and crisp beer!"
"I keep hearing rumors about ""oh, it's not the beer it once was--no more wooden conditioning casks, don't you know.""  I've probably had about 500 samples of this one, and they varied widely.  The best (in a Vienna movie theater) showed off an incredibly integrated hop and malt flavors, with a certain flintiness that was simply incredible.  At worst, it tasted like hopped water or diacetyl nastiness.  Tasted at the Czech embassy recently, I found it to have wonderful malt and hops, vying for prominence and ending in a nice dry hop finish.  Goes well with absinthe."
...........................................................................
...........................................................................
"the classic lager.  lovely sweet malt and a good dose of hops.  I've heard this beer was better years ago, I would love to have tried it then.  very enjoyable."
...........................................................................
probably the best beer all around the world.................................
The first golden beer in the world!!........................................
THE best beer... and I have tasted quite a lot of them......................
The great beer with great taste.............................................
"This beer rocks... kind of. A very good beer. One of the world's better Pilseners, but not the best. I don't care if it WAS the first. A very good summer beer. Please take into account that I'm not really a fan of this style of beer."
"Hoppy goodness, distinctive.  Certainly can be appreciated for being a more bold (and original) version of the pilsener.  A bit on the fizzy side, and certainly the bitterness comes through."
Slightly sour tasting beer with a thick texture and a large degree of bitterness.  Different compared to a lot of other pilsners but a lot better.
Even though this is the original Pils both bottles I had were skunked I'm not a big fan of this one
"One the the best mass produced beers.  No wonder more it is drunk each year than any other beer.  Slightly bitter at the end, but very smooth.  Plus you can get it for pretty cheap."
Out of the bottle: Beautiful crystal clear deep golden colour.  Malty and saaz hop bitterness resound in perfectly in the front end. Very rounded out flavour profile with light hoppy flavour and no hop aroma.
"I had one of these out of a bottle at the Old Bag of Nails Pub in Worthington.  Sweet nose of apples, pears, and vanilla.  Pours a light bubbly golden with an average sized white and frothy head that has great lacing.  The flavor is deep; outstanding for a Pils.  Hints of dried fruit and vanilla are prominent.  Very balanced with no acidity.  The body is soft, creamy and smooth.  The finish feels clean.  Hands down the best Pils I have ever tasted.  I couldn't have imagined rating a Pils so high before tonight."
"first time i tried it made me sick didn't like the taste. must have had a bad bottle.
second time i tried it i loved it.
very good pilsner, tasted just like it was off of tap.
will try again."
"Not a Pils drinker, but a good intro beer to those moving up from Bud to a quality, flavorful beer."
"A decent, drinkable beer. But it was a let down for something considered the ""Original"" Pilsner. I have had better. Maybe its all subjective, but this is another one from across the pond that is highly over-rated. And I like Pilsner. I may try again, but I won't pay for it. Re-rate: Tried this again. I must have got a bad batch the first time. Crisp, clean, nice hop bite. An all around excellent beer."
"The best Pilsner I've had. A Czech friend of mine says the version we get in the US is hoppier than the original; I find this difficult to imagine, as the hops are so subtle in the first place that they aren't the main focus of this brew. For some reason, the lunkheads at the pub I frequent most list this in the menu as being German. May the ghost of Josef Svejk haunt them until such time as they repent this error... Rerate 9/5/02: I had one of these from the bottle and it was even better than I remembered; like sticking my head into a sack of Saaz hops, all grassy and herby. I take back what I said about…"
"It's a classic and rightly so. Crisp and spicy, subtle malty sweetness late and a clean, hoppy finish."
"Either I got a skunky six, or I just don't care for this pilsener. Bitter and skunkish, but with no redeeming aftertaste or complex palate to balance it out. I'm going to hope that my bottles saw too much light."
"Pretty good pilsner.  Tried on draft.  Found this beer crisp and refreshing, but I wasn't too impressed with the hop profile - I was expecting more.  Also a little thin  for my palate but still easy drinking."
"Suffered from green-bottle stinkyness, but tasted ok, and is a pretty good yardstick when rating other pilsners."
Great beer to eat pizza or cheese with.  Nice flowery bitterness but still with a good balance.  Gorgeous dark golden color.  One of the best pilsners yet.
"Better in Europe, but even in the US still a measuring stick by which to gauge classic pilsners.  Those who rate it poorly must be ale-aholics.  Solid color and not too carbonated.  Perfect malt flourish with just the right hop after."
A beer with a clear dark yellow color but ufortunatly almost no head. It has a slightly hoppy aroma - and the nice bitter flavor of hops. For a pilsener this is one of the very best.
"I was suprised at how dark this bbeer was. Being used to seeing watery yellow pilsners this was a deep golden color, with a bubbly head that didn't last long. The aroma was a slightly sour floweriness. Initial flavor was smooth malt with a light hop ending (very refreshing) After that however it became increasingly bitter and leaving a sour taste in the back of the throat. Overall not a bad brew and better than I had expected."
"Had on tap, MUCH better than the stuff in green bottles. Nice hop aroma/bite. Could do lots of these."
"I guess I just went into the experience with expectations that weren't met.  It's not bad, it's just overrated.  Intense sour aroma and taste, refreshing only when very cold and it's very hot outside."
I drank this beer accidently last week. I passed out drunk in the bathroom and some  one was using my mouth as a urinal. I thought directly from the tap would be better but i was wrong
"Re-rate 08/17/02: Clear gold in color, the head is large, frothy, brilliant white, the lace is in sheets. Nose is malt, sweet, a bit perfumy. Front sweet, the top light, the finish is nicely hopped and dry, acidic, and to me still one of the best ""Pils"" brewed anywhere. Ranks #418 on my current 1000 beer master list."
"Nice golden in color.  Head sinks quickly.  Some maltiness but most of the aroma is coming from the Saaz hops, they also give this pils some bite.  Overall, a pretty decent pilsner."
"I'm usually not a big pilsner fan, but this one is quite good... watch out for the six packs; don't know how long they sit exposed to light... green bottle doesn't help"
"Nice aroma, crisp taste, lots of bitterness present, but 
not too much bitterness.  Has that canned European 
pilsener taste, but not as overpowering as the German 
counterparts.  I like some other pilseners better, but this…"
"A very pleasing summer beer with a very fresh, but not fruity aroma and taste."
"I have had the beer in a bottle and vomited uncontrollably.  One of my friends had in on tap at the Flying Saucer, so i gave it a shot a little better but still had a bad aftertaste."
"This classic pilsener combines classic Saaz hops aroma and flavour with a full malty body.  The malt body is distinguishable in the aroma, which sweetens as the beer settles.  The off-white head is thick with small bubbles, not soapy like some other pilseners.  IT has a moderately light body with a fine malt balance, which lingers in the aftertaste.  My favourite pilsener."
Lovely colour.  Strong but not overpowering hops.  A great beer to push away the memory of typical mass produced dreck.  An excellent choice to accompany Chicken Wings at the Keg.
"One of my favorites of my limited repetoire.  However, I think it does depend, as many have said, on the bottle one gets."
"nice pilsner with actual flavor, a little darker than most pilsners, much better than any of the other brand names out there."
One of the best! Great body & authority. Good color & aroma. A true classic pilsner!
"This starts with that distinct, assertive Saaz aroma...Rich golden color with a healthy honeycombed head...very inviting...Flavors revolve around the rich hop profile. Malt is subtle in flavor but provides good body. Finish is medium-dry with slight tang.  This is a solid performer, striking difficult balance of refreshment, substance and full-flavor. It is a unique product, well-deserving of its stature as a world classic."
"Fantastic! great taste, refreshing, crisp and clean. ......................."
"Refreshing,cleandry pilsner,never a letdown................................."
"A nice fresh, clean pilsner with a long and dry finish.  A solid, reliable classic."
i was disappointed with this beer. i expected better from what is supposedly the original. it has an ordinary taste and there are much better pilsners.
"Good flavor, but still a light light for my tastes.........................."
A sensational pilsner that's at the top of the class.  Very drinkable with a terrific saaz hop aroma.  Very solid and enjoyable.
"The best thing about this beer is that it's been around for almost 800 years.  Other than that, it's nothing very special.  Nice color, not too watery, but the taste is pretty ordinary."
"The original pilsener, makes you think its kinda funny how a lot of american beers refer to themselves as pilseners.  I little skunky for my taste."
"Probably the best lager I have had, less blad, and some flavour to it, but I don't really like lagers."
"Very tasty pilsener. Refreshing to say the least, I think it is what pilsener should be. If it were cheaper I would drink it often- expecially in the summer."
tast like it has been brewed in an old boot.  has  a really strong yeast aftertaste
"Light, smooth.. what a pilsner should be.
Why cant americans get it right?
I was impressed."
the benchmark by which all others attempt to emulate........................
Crisp clear cant be beat with a stick on a hot day light bodied.............
A good pilsner.  I would get it again if I was looking for a lighter beer...
"Very impressive pilsner, and what is even more impressive is that I found it in one of the biggest shithole of bars in the world.  Tried it just to see what the supposed ""first pilsner ever"" was like and was very pleased.  The hype behind it was probably the best quality of the beer, but the aroma and taste were nothing to complain about one bit."
"Considering this was the original pils, it's a good thing brewers did not hew too close to the original. The aroma is overwhelming and it doesn't have a good aftertaste."
"One of the best pilseners in the world, but quite expensive................."
"A decient pilsner. The green bottle usually cries out a warning to me, but the light didn't effect the flavor from what I could tell. It was what was to be expected. A fully body, with a rich head, in a lovely hue of gold. Everything you'd expect from a Pilsner. It doesn't go down as smooth as I'd like, but still a fine beer."
"I actually would rather rate this in Prague when I am paying 50 cents for half a liter instead of the imported price, but I'll manage.  This is a great pilsner with a good body and taste.  It also is a great chaser for absynthe."
None to bad a choice if you're looking for a cheaper Pilsner. I prefer this to any of the mass-marketed German Pilsners out there. I'm told you can buy this beer for 35cents in Prague. See you in Prague.
"BARF!!! I was forced to drink this garbage to become a member of the ""suds club"" at the local pub, I haven't decided if it was worth it."
"Malty and hoppy aroma and taste with some hay. It starts with some malty, almost buttery sweetness on the tongue, immediately followed by a hoppy, but soft bitterness. Long hopbitter finish. Good pilsener, but doesn't live up completely to its reputation."
This beer smelled so damned good I nearly brought the empty bottle back with me from Hawaii just to sniff a few more times. Damned tasty brew! One I will have many more of.
"Medium, foamy white head. Light golden yellow color. Medium strength nose - hoppy and vegetable notes. Light and crisp palate. Typical pilsner taste: light hops, skunky, vegetal. Pretty standard in my book and boring in my book."
"Don't know why it took me so long to get around to trying this stuff--must be my ale fetish keeping me away from the pilseners. Anyway, really enjoyed this. Malt flavor dominates, sweet and slightly caramel flavors complement a taste not unlike good artisinal bread. Finishes with a nice crisp hop bitterness."
Slightly skunky aroma. Good clean looking beer. Skunkiness evident in flavor. Must find this on tap somewhere. It has got to be better than this.
"Terrific, great mouth feel, very enjoyable.................................."
I'll rate the fresh samples i've had.  Although the hops and body have diminished in the last few years the sharp spicy saaz aroma is one of the tops.  Dark clear straw color.  Nice malt body that has also thinned as of late.  Still a nice dry bitter finish.  When fresh - still one of the best examples.
"I'll have to try this one again and re-rate it because I think what I had on tap was spoiled. It tasted skunky, and sour."
"With all the hype surrounding this beer, I can only conclude that the keg at the bar was infected.  I'll have to try it again at another bar to know for sure.  ADDENDUM:  I tried Urquell on draught at a different bar and it was infected again.  Tasted exactly like the first sampling - vinegary.  2ND ADDENDUM: Three strikes and you're out.  Bud, Foster's, Sam Adams and Urquell were my choices so I went for the Urquell with a great deal of scepticism considering my two previous experiences.  Vinegar strikes again, making Urquell 3 for 3 on that score for me.  There comes a time when you…"
"Not nearly as bad as I expected.  I drank it on draft and it wasn't as skunky as everyone says it is in the US.  Probably the best pilsner I've had, but that doesn't say a hell of a lot.  Light, slightly hoppy, very clear."
"not much of a pilsner fan but this is pretty good, nice hop presence, aroma was a tad skunky, if I have to drink a pilsner this is the one i prefer"
"I recently tried this at a party. It is a fairly light beer with a slight skunky smell to it, overpowering the hops element. I found it to not be the most drinkable pilsner I have had.  Slightly bitter."
"Judging by some of the previous comments, I found a good bottle. Beautiful clarity, nice aroma, good taste of hops."
"I know this beer is supposed to be special when really fresh, i.e., in the Czech Republic, but my draft example was weak, had no aroma and little character. I admit there was an elegant hoppiness to it but little else. Very dry finish."
............................................................................
AN OLD FAVORITE RECENTLY VISITED THE BREWERY. WHAT A GREAT CANNED BEER FROM THE SOURCE GREAT ON DRAFT ALSO
"Challenging in many ways - challenging to find it in good shape here in Michigan but then, when you do, a challenge to sensibilities dulled to the style.  This one has quite an earthy body for a lighter beer and a dancing smile of hops."
"Nice and malty, yet clean mouthfeel. Saaz hops not overdone as other pilseners tend to be. Enjoyable and refreshing."
"Unthrilling appearance, but better than average pilsner.  Enjoyed the unique bitter mouthfeel.  Easygoing after one."
"Bottle rated. A good beer, hoppy and bitter, nice aroma. Probably not the best pilsner in the world but in the top 10."
I had a skunked bottle so I will have to re-rate............................
"This a beer that will not bore you. An excitingly complex palate with some bitterness combined with a very smooth body make it one of my all time favorites. The bottled version doesn't quite compare to the real thing you get in Praha. If you have never had one, well, your loss..."
"Tap.  One of the finest pilsners available.  Clean, sharp, dry flavor......."
Nice golden colour. Intense bitterness for a pilsener but guite a disapointing finish.
"one of the best tasting pilsners around
..................................."
Just my type of gal. Nice aroma and colorful almond/golden hue. Fresh sharp taste with a strong presence. Very refreshing.
"Easy drinking and refreshing.Wonderful aroma and a sharp, clean taste......."
"A pilsener as good as pilseners get. Rerate: Had it from can this time, still the benchmark of a good pilsener. Only 4,4% now, but I remember (I think!) that the alcohol content was about 5,2% when I first had it (in Germany) many years ago?!"
"Not my type of beer, but a nice aroma with a fairly good sharp/bitter taste."
"I am not a big fan of Pilsners, but this was refreshing and light. I drank it fairly fast, because it was very nasty when it was warm. It had a slight bite on the front, but was pretty blah on the backend. Overall, I thought it was OK"
"by far the best pilsner i've ever tasted. a slightly dry tastes, and a real nice golden color.
great if your having one or if ya need a case to make it through the night."
"Quality hoppy golden beer,very smooth a great alternative to any domestic or canadian golden beer."
"This is truly a special brew. I've had Urquell on several occasions, but this is the first time I noticed the undertones of hop bitterness. That adds another special component to what I had already deemed a superior beer. It has a roasted malty aroma and a deep golden hue. A thin layer of head remains throughout. Pilsner Urquell is as tasty as it is noble."
"You know what, i kinda like that skunky taste. I usually don't find that anyway. There's a little bitterness but at a cool temp, it's nice and crisp"
It would be unfair if I comment too much on this beer. The reason being I love it more than any other beer on earth.
"Quite a nice beer especially considering the style.
Smells a bit skunky.  Nice golden color, remember this
is the first non-dark beer.  A proper respect for history is 
proper.  Good flavor, with nice hop bitterness."
"A good pilsener. Light coloured, smells hoppy and just the right bitterness. Had another bottle the other night. Tastes better every time"
"This is a great pilsener. For some reason, they bottle this beer in green bottles which causes it's skunky flavor when exposed to light. Get this beer fresh and on tap and you will be amazed. Great hop aroma and flavor. Intense bitterness for a pilsener, almost to the point of being overhopped. No skunkiness when drank fresh and on tap. Pilseners are given a bad name by so many of the sub-par American light lagers. Get a fresh pint of PU to find out what a real pilsener should taste like."
"Got this on tap hoping I could avoid the skunkiness . . . no such luck.  Obviously the Pilsner to end all Pilsners, but just not up my alley."
"I am not a pilsner fan, but this was quite good. the problems with Pilsner Urquell is the same, in my eyes, with every pilsner. A little skunky, not enough body, no head, but something about this one kinda grabbed me. I'd drink another sixer of it."
"A little too skunky for me, b ut the dry flavor and nice hops finish on this beer are redeeming qualities."
"This beer has a Real skunk smell to it, and is quite bitter your first round, but after aquiring a taste for it(or getting sloshed), it starts to grow on you! It took me 4 to Really start to enjoy this guy!"
"Most of the time, this beer is skunked. But once in awhile, you can get a good one. The best pilsner(lager) I've ever had. Lots of woody, smokey flavor balanced with a mild hop finish."
Not bad for its style...its been a long winter of darks so I don't feel like a fair judge.
"Drinking this beer in the Czech Republic is nothing like drinking it from an imported bottle.  There, it is a light, tasty, sharp pils.  Here, it is terrible crap."
"Skunk is the major aroma, but if you can make it past that it isn't really too bad. I rate it right there with czechvar (a few points behind the better pils to the west)"
I could smell the crappy skunk smell from across the room!  I hope this was just a bad bottle. It tasted like Budweiser that had skunked - unless I held my breath while I drank it - and then it tasted like regular Budweiser.
"Quote from my fiancee: ""Does 'crappy' have one or 2 p's?"" That says it all. I think I had a bottle that was exposed to the light too long because the skunk smell was literally unbearable. Whatever positives in the flavor were drowned out by the horrid stench. I will have to try this one again sometime..."
............................................................................
"Very good; can really taste the Saaz hops, for which this beer is famous - if you haven't ever had this beer, it's worth trying simply for the original hop character."
"This is probably the best pilsner I've had, except for the czech microbrew beer I had when I was there."
"Not good. Way to biting. Nearly killed my mouth. I had to stop drinking for about a day. Which, if you know me, is a big deal."
"Not a pilsner lover, I always find this one to be a pleasant surprise.  It is flavorful without being bitter.  It has a clean, but fairly complex, palate that is fun to dissect, if you're paying attention to it, but easy to just drink and enjoy.  FAR superior to your typical American pilsner."
Im not a big pilsner fan but I just wasn't all that impressed. I had it off of tap so there were no skunkage issues. I just didnt' thing the flavor profile was all that broad.
"The ""original"" pils. Need I say more........................................"
"Never thought I would rank a pilsner this high, but this is a prety good beer. Has a decent flavor, unlike most pilsners you can tell its a beer and not water, I like that."
"Sort of reminds me of a mellow Heineken.  The smell is rather nice, but the taste is nothing spectacular, and perhaps the sour taste comes a little too late to be apprechiated.  A little less substance than I like, but perhaps that's more the nature of this style.  There is a sort of satisfying dry wheaty flavor that settles on the tounge."
"Slight hopiness in smell and taste.  Like every pilsener, the bland yellow color dosen't entice.  Has an interesting syrup-like quality, perhaps from the malts, that sets it apart from other thin pilseners.  Not bad, especially if it truly was the very first pilsener"
"One of the best, if you get a good bottle. I've found uneven quality. Have had some really skunky stuff."
"I'm not too big on Pilsners, but this is drinkable. The color's nice, although perhaps a bit too much bitterness for such an otherwise light flavor."
"transparent golden colour, fine head, herbal nose, full-bodied, slightly oily, long dry finish, well-balanced - an over-rated legend of the pilsner-style"
"On tap at a PF Changs. Nice sweetish taste with a reasonable hop nose. Perhaps the only pilsner I can honestly say that I like. Although, judging other reviews I'd be hesitant to buy it in a bottle."
This one is best served on tap in Europe.  This is still my favorite beer I have ever put into my mouth.  It's just okay in the States.
This is THE pilsner. It is unfair to put any other beer in the same category. The hops jump out and grab your nose as soon as the bottle is opened.
Best pilsner around. Supposedly the best pilsner in the world...............
The original and finest pilsner.  Widely available and amazing.  Wonderful balance of hops and flavor.  Smooth.
An excellent lager which utilizes the Saaz hops for flavor.  It has a crisp fresh creaminess and a very pleasant aroma.  I give it an extra point for OI because of the spring water used on-site when brewing. ;)
"satisfying, smooth, and great tasting all the way through. more complex than any ripoff pilsner. good balance of hops and malt, light flower aroma. expensive, but its a beer you have to try at least once. can't drink a lot of it though."
Just add me to the long list of drinkers who complain about widely varying quality - why don't they put this stuff in brown bottles?
"I'm not really a pils guy, but this is undeniably impressive................"
"Don't understand what's so great about this beer, and why so many people like it."
Nothing special considering all the hype surrounding this beer..............
It goes down very easy and is a great example of a pilsner..................
"I am basing this review on the best Pilsner Urquell that I have ever had.  But usually it is not up to par, this beer is notorious for not travelling well, and this is well deserved as you will generally get a mediocre if not downright bad bottle.  But if you get a good one it is a great pilsener.  Must be great at the source..."
"Rich honey and leathery taste glides down too easily. Flowery slightlysweet and delish. Bring it on, try it in a factory glass,even better. Encore"
"Golden coloured. Fresh from tap the aromatic, oily saaz aroma is very evident. It is rather dry, medium bodied and has a great deal of bitterness. One of the best megabrewed beers around."
"Something about the smell that always makes me nostalgic for something, but not sure what.  A great taste that is enhanced by the odd smell of the beer."
I had smelled that smell in a nasty Heiny years before and I was scared.Man what a surprise If that taste is saaz hops I'll have aheapin' plenty.Great taste.Great Beer.I think I'll have more.
"More hoppiness than usual for a ""commercial"" beer.  Overall a good, not great beer."
"pretty good pilsner. i prefer Brooklyn, though.  this is a bit light for me."
Great pilsener with lovely hops flavour.....................................
............................................................................
"King of all pilsners! If I was a pils drinker and it wasn't so expensive I wouldn't drink anything else (except for milk). Strong flowers and perfume in the aroma. Orange/golden colour, large forthy white head, good lacing. Sweet for a pilsner, soft, very full, lots of flavors, malt, flowers. Long sweet and hopbitter finish."
one of the best tatsing pilsners ive had yet deffently on my next shopping list
"If you're Czech, Pilsner Urquell is the equivalent of American Bud. That's not to say it's bad at all -- infact, I think it's a great beer. But it's a relatively commercial beer and therefore you should adjust your expectations accordingly. I found it excellent to grab a bottle or two alongside a meal when I lived in Prague. And at around US$0.20/bottle, you can't beat it!"
"Not a bad pilsner, just not my favorite, either.  The green bottle scared me, but it wasn't all that skunky smelling, and the skunk was more well hidden in the taste.  After a few sips, it became slightly sweet and more drinkable.  I liked the hoppy bite and the maltiness came through as well.  No hint of alcohol at first, either, but that made its appearance at the finish.  Overall, a good pilsner, as I said earlier, but I will most likely drink it again only if someone else buys it."
"Very good pilsner, made in the town the style is named after, Plzen.  The malts are nice, but don't be fooled -- the malts are only there to serve as a counterweight to the blast of Bohemian hops.  i'm not a big pilsner fan, but i'm always happy to drink this one.  One suggestion:  hit the brewery -- it tastes better in Plzen than it does in the States (slightly different recipe)."
"Full, sweet malt aroma and a dark gold color
make this enjoyable before the first sip.
Big taste - malty and bitter. Warm filling 
mouthfeel. Overall fantastic. Lives up to…"
"Traditionally THE pilsner, floral hop aroma, beautifully balanced, and a clean finish.One caveat-the Budvar (Czeckvar) now available stateside is dated, Pilsner Urquell would do well to emulate this-in the meanwhile, make sure you purchase in a good store, with high turn-over...NASTRAVE!"
"What a great beer! My dad's favorite! I am not him however, but this stuff is pretty good for a Check beer. No aftertaste (At last not with Chili) good for Summers, or football season!"
"It was great, because I got it for free as a birthday gift, but otherwise it was pretty much on the negative side.  Extremely bland flavor and a sharply bitter aftertaste.  It barely had an appearance as it is nearly clear with a slight brown tint too it, and it really (no really) didn't smell like I should even taste it. So yeah, I liked it, right."
"I didn't care for this beer to much, too bitter with a bad aftertaste......."
"The colour of this beer was wonderful. A bright gold. Oddly enough, this beer smelled like furniture polish and it didn't taste much better. :("
"This has a ""skunky"" aftertaste like many of the green bottle German Beers.  The fresher the better as this one seems to get skunkier with any aging."
"Because of its high reputation, I have tried this several times and have always been disappointed.  Always seems skunked in Aus. (Green Bottles?) Also is a bit light at only 4.4%. Would like to try on tap though."
"My thing is darks, stouts, and porters. But, every once in a while I like to try a few Pilseners. As far as Pils go, this is one of my favorites. Crisp and flavorful. I have tried it cold and also at around 45 deg or so. I think I like it better at the warmer temp. A friend tells me that if you ever get to Europe, try to get to the Czech Republic and visit the town of Pilsen. It's where it all started for Pilsner beer and you can tour the factory and taste a fresh batch."
Has a lot of rich malt flavor for a light colored Pilsner. They are best ice cold.
"Golden colored with average size head.  Malty bready aroma.  Malty, grassy taste with a nice hop bitterness."
"My first go at it was the Chech! Damn! What a nice surprise! And guess what the beer even tastes great as an import to the USA, which is a shock! Most beers brought over loose something! This one is a classic! Add it to your pilsner list!"
"One of the best, for good reason. The hops come to the fore quite quickly, both in the taste and aroma. It has to be one of the nicest-smelling beers around. But taste is most important, and it doesn't disappoint. Mild but full of rich hoppy flavor. I can never stop with just one."
"Hop aroma and flavor were nice, but just not of the intensity that I remember.  It just lacked the kick I recall it having."
I had this beer on draft served in a tall (official) glass that compensated for the nice head of this beer.  Aftertaste was not overwhelming but the hop flavor was there.  Definitely a fine beer on draft.
"Bready, bitter aftertaste. Garden-variety pils. Not bad....................."
Good slightly bitter mellow taste. The smell is somewhat like sewer gas.....
Nice lager with well balanced bitterness....................................
I love this beer. It's like Heineken made right. The only problem is it is too expensive...but damn tasty!!
"I guess what they say about imported beer in green bottles is true. SKUNKY!!
Well after my hurl-fest of drinking this from the green bottle, I tried it out of the cool tall can, and it wasn't bad at all. Therefore I have changed my previous rating. It goes down very smooth with a fine bitter aftertaste."
"An ok pilsener, but the aroma is skunky. Nice flavor, but the palate is too tart."
"I have had this beer several times and have never been impressed. Faint, rather unsavory aroma, does have a crisp flavor, but has an unsatisfactory aftertaste and an unpleasant dry bitterness."
"The original by which all others are measured. Excellent is the only way to describe it. A good beer to drink when youare actually thirsty.I noticed someone mentioned not getting a hang over whn drinking it. A point of interest, alot of American brews use preservatives, namely Formaldehyde. And this is the reason for alot of hangovers concerning beers. When drinking a german beer, look for the German purity act on the label, and seek an expiration date. Beer should expire like anything else that has been cooked. In Germany most brewers brew for a local populaion not the country. So…"
not bad if you can get over the smell.......................................
Wonderful Beer..............................................................
Crisp like fresh celery. My favorite beer when pure thirstiness takes over. Great bitter edge.
"had it only once, palatable................................................."
"Pilsner Urquell should be drunk from a keg.  One of the best experiences was tasting it over a long period.  The beer changed as the keg went down.  This is an incredible beer on tap, I think it sucks in the bottle, heat treated and God knows what chemicals.  Drink it on tap and then rate it.  I love this beer."
"I see that there are alot of people out there that like this beer.  I think I am going to have to agree with some of the people here and say this wasn't what I was expecting.  I didn't care for this at all.  But I didn't want to bring it's overall rating down just on my thoughts of it.  I would have rated it 1's and 2's across the board.  The only thing I liked about this beer was it's nice golden color.  I don't think I could bring myself to try this one again.  Update:  A friend bought some so I tried it again.  I think when I bought it origionally, I got an old lot.  So I am bumping up my rating a bit."
This one is what all other Pilsner beers want to be. A truly perfect Pils. I have had a lot when I was in Prague a couple of years ago and not once had a hangover. I would love to try this one from the barrel as I only had the tall bottles.
Nice classic pils I love it.  Best from the barrel..........................
"Great beer, a sharp, slightly hoppy pilsner that I enjoy, even though half the bottles I get are skunked.  Why green bottles?  Grr..."
Salty nose. Tasted like a mild ham and egg sandwich for some reason. Second and third tastes proved the same. Impressed with this beer that tastes like food. Medium carbonation with a short head. Copper-gold color. Sweet 'apple juice-like' finish.
Too long ago to remember much about this beer.  I do remember that it is good.
"When it's fresh, it's clean, nicely hopped with a pleasing bitterness......."
"I don't care for whatever standing it has among ""beer critics,"" this was bad. Perhaps the batch I had was skunky. But I'm not willing to give it a second shot. There are too many beers in the world to pass up, instead."
"The best pilsner I've had when not skunky.  I bought it in an enclosed 12-pack, maybe that helped.  That's the only way I'll buy it."
simply a good beer nothing bad sticks out about it..........................
"Overall this beer is nicely refreshing.
Lightly hopped flavor balancing very
well with the malt flavor.  Nice summer beer."
"In good shape this is still a world class beer, too bad so many 6 packs here in the states sit under florecent lights or collecting dust getting skunky and stale.
Bitter and refreshing with fine lace."
"You know, I've never had a good time with this stuff and because of all the brouha I've given it a decent shot.  It just seems kind of meager, a bit sour, and unclean even."
This has to be the best pils in the world.  Anyone who compares it to any other pils is crazy!  It is the original and only Pils from the town of Pilsen.
"A little bitter, but it's that German-type taste............................"
"I guess I have been pretty lucky, because all the Pilsner Urquell bottles I've had in this country have been absolutely beautiful .. This is the absolute definition of a pilsner and anything that lables itself as such has to be compared against this (start trembling, Miller Lite!). Luscious golden color.. wonderful hops.. Ahh , I want to go to the Czech Republic and swim in their tanks...…"
By far the finest Pils I have had.  Even the American bottled version isn't bad.  Nothing compares to a fresh Urquell in Praha.  Fantastic!
"Clear, golden with a thin head. I honestly expected it to be skunked(green bottle)but it wasnt. Wonderful nose of full malt and saaz hoppiness. This is really good and im sure it would be magificent if i could get it fresher. Full malt body with herbal notes with a dry saaz finish. Tremendous balance and flavor for such a ""light"" beer. A must try."
"I have had many different experiences with this brew. On draft very good and occasionlly good in the bottle. When everything is right, a world class pilsner."
"After all the hype I had heard, I expected more than what I got.  It was skunky indeed.  I tried to pop the top bartender style and broke glass off the neck.  I should have poured it out assuming that some glass had fallen into the beer...but I ended up drinking it unfortunately."
"Decent Pils.  It was skunky, but I liked it better than St. Pauli Girl.  Drinkable"
"Best beer in the world. Don’t drink it from the bottle, pour it into a Pilsner glass and just sit and enjoy that aroma, your first sip should make your eyes roll back into your head from pleasure. I’ve lived and traveled to quite a few places on earth and have to say I’ve not found a better beer. Although I’ve not yet been to the Czech Republic I did drink this fresh in Italy and Germany. And judging from the amount of spent bottles I saw laying in German trash cans I can honestly say that the Berliners at least love this stuff! Budvar used to be #1 on my list, but that was before I tasted Pilsner Urquell."
This should be ranked as a great beer.  Definitely worth the price..........
pretty good brew. kind of a dry taste.......................................
Classic.....................................................................
Unbeatable!!!!..............................................................
"Ok, so it's very seldom fresh at all in North America.  I just remember a few years ago in Halifax when I had some straight off the boat.  That's where these high marks come from. When fresh, this is a first-rate pilsner.  When not fresh, well, it's like any other beer that isn't fresh. Usually on this side of the ocean you'll want to get it on tap or from the can, to avoid skunkage."
"I can't believe that the batch I got was fresh. It was relatively flat tasting and reminded me of a slightly better version of the American pilsener. I'd LOVE to give this a try fresh, Im sure it would receive higher marks."
A very good beer............................................................
It may be a classic but it is too much meant for an international market to really have a unique taste.
............................................................................
"One of the least consistent beers around.  When fresh, it's great, with a crisp hoppiness that's perfect on warm days.  Unfortunately, it's often not fresh, since it's now being brewed in greater quantities and being distributed to all sorts of stores where it just doesn't get sold fast enough.  Hit or miss."
"Nice pilsner.  Goes down well.  Not too much bite to it, although my wife could do without it"
A true Pilsner.  Such a marked step-up from the mass-produced cheap American swill.
great pils.  props to my czech buddies in plzny.............................
Probably the best non-Danish pilsner........................................
"If God drinks beer on sundays, this is the one..(-: IMHO THE pilsner...Cheers!"
"Good for a pilsner.  I dotn really like thids style too much.  Almost a ""pepper"" taste to it.  Very clean beer."
"has a aroma I shouldn't describe, taste was slightly better................."
My opinions are skewed by the fact that my Pilsner Urquell was completely and totally skunked.    From what I gather this is often the case.   My ratings are based on just one drink.    If you want a more detailed review you should ask the sink I poured my bottle down.
"Definitely I have nothing critical to say about Urquell. The greatest Pislner! Especially the draught one, sure. With fantastic bitterness, palate, aroma and nice white head."
"when fresh this beer has a mild and pleasent flavor, those who got skunky beer should give there negative comments to the store who sold them old stock?"
"i've seen other beer-raters refer to ""skunk brew"", well this is as close to ""skunk brew"" as i've ever come across"
"I heard such great things about this beer and i was so dissapointed with it. It had a really bad taste to it. It must just be me, but i really did not care for this one."
"One of the greatest beers of the world.  It needs care in serving:  The right temperature and patience in pouring are crucial, and if done well, will reward you greatly.  (When you order a Pilsner in Europe, you can expect to wait about 20 minutes.  It takes that long to pour it the right way.)"
"If Pilsner's your passion, then you can't go wrong with this.
The aroma's fresh - like an ocean breeze.
It has a nice, hoppy flavor, with a very pleasing malt aftertaste.
Try this in a clear glass - appreciate it's beauty and clarity."
"not much going on here. some taste of saaz hops but it fades quickly.

..."
"Though I dont give it a high rating, not a bad Pilsner. Balanced flavors. Strong aroma. I am just not a big fan of the Pils."
"Although it has apparently lost complexity in the past decade, this beer still sets the standard for pilsners. Has a depth that its imitators do not, and an easy drinking style in the best sense of the term. Love those Saaz cones!!"
This is the worst lager ever to be made (except for Carling)................
"Crisp flavor, hoppy aftertaste, very refreshing. Easy to drink a lot of....."
............................................................................
"Complex and rewarding.  Unlike most Pilsners, has a wide variety of tastes that keeps you on your toes.  Pleasant aftertaste and low alcohol content makes a good summer sipper."
............................................................................
"6 weeks ago I would have loved this beer, as I have been drinking darker, heavier, more complex beers lately this seemed very plain to me. A nice dark yellow color, with a thin white head. Yeasty, earthy aroma, slight bit of alcohol pervades. Light mouthfeel, very light, somewhat earthy."
"Very good here, much better over there.  Good on tap, but I don't think these European pilsner type beers travel (or store)very well.  I was told the Czech's sell all their good hops to Germany."
............................................................................
............................................................................
"My first beer of the night, rationale being it would probably be the most delicate.  Lush, creamy, white head with a clear, golden color.  Earthy, smooth, and yeasty, hops were present but not overwhelming.  Zero sweetness. Slightly bitter finish, with noticeable bight on back of tongue. Yeasty aroma corresponded well with overall taste of beer.  Not earth-shattering, but good."
............................................................................
"Pilsner Urquell is a very nice in appearance pils. However, unless you live next to the Czech Republic, getting one of these that is fresh and non-skunked is tough.  I have tried this beer a few times and have been disappointed in its bitter, skunked taste.  I will re-visit it again and hope for a fresh one!  Revisited 6/24/01 and I am still disappointed.  Light struck/skunked and undrinkable.  My whole family remarked on how bad the glass of beer smelled.  I still say you have to live in the Czech Republic or get lucky to get a fresh version of this beer"
"Probably my all around favorite beer.  If a better balanced brew exists, I want to know what it is.  For a relatively light beer, Pilsner Urquell is as complex as anything I've tasted.  It has that PERFECT hops-malt balancing act going, plus that European grainy taste.  It's almost like a well done German wheat, except it has hop complexity.  Flavorful and rich, yet thirst quenching and refreshing.  PU is tops in my book."
"THE original pilsner is pretty average.  Take one whiff... skunk.  Try a sip... better, but still only average."
It smelled kinda skunky but had a crisp taste to it.  Nothing too special...
"I had heard very good things about this beer. It's considered a classic or so i thought. Until I tried it. I barely could finish it. Had little flavor or aroma or much of any redeeming quality. Definitely disappointed. It might be better than Budweiser or that class of beer, but that isn't saying a whole lot."
It's the reason we can all rag on Bud and Miller............................
"Supposedly its gone down in quality in the last 10 years, but Pilsner Urquell remains a terrific beer.  Very soft body for a Pilsner, and very flowery nose.  The sulfur is supposed to be there, but when you try it on tap, its less prevalent.  You can't say you like beer if you don't like Pilsner Urquell."
............................................................................
Pleasant hoppiness.  Nice balance...........................................
"Nothing like drinking the ""original pilsner"". Full bodied with a spicey hopness. Pairs well with many foods. A great example of what american pilsner's should be."
............................................................................
"I knew from the moment I popped it that it wasn't a good day.  This bottle was skunked.
Even without this it didn't have all that much flavor and really wasn't very good.  If they can't ke it from skunkin they shouldn't sell it.
What a disappointment!"
............................................................................
"Of course, this beer defines pilsner.  I guess I'm lucky enough to have not experienced the ""skunk"" factor in the bottles.  I've never had this beer on draft...but if it's better than the bottled version I'll be in heaven. 
Simply incredible beer. The bubbles seem to dance to the top of the glass. The hop/malt balance comes out on the side of the hops, and it's just perfect.  Golden, clear, lively.  A super beer!"
"Avoid the bottled version - badly skunked 99% of the time.  I finally had this on tap, and WOW.  Truly full bodied, with a very pronounced hop bitterness - and a wonderful one at that.  I finally know what ""A True Pilsner Beer"" tastes like, and it ain't Miller Lite."
No question for me: Excellent! .............................................
"Skunked.  Badly.  Hate to give it this bad of a rating, but they do put it in the green bottle and should know better.  I do like pilsners, so that was not the problem."
"Ok, I tried it to see what the ""best a pilsner has to offer"" might be like - and, hate to say it - it still smells like bud, it still tastes like bud.  I couldn't even finish the bottle."
"Ideal version of the style.  Clean and crisp, 
with enough body to really taste it.
The pils hoppiness is very apparent.
The golden color is pleasing to the eye and…"
............................................................................
"Seems to be true to style, but perhaps this style just doesn't suit my palate."
One of the few best beer's in the world.....................................

"Burk 500 ml från Systembolaget. Gyllengul färg, smakrik, beska som ligger kvar i munnen efter att man svalt. En mycket bra Tjeckisk lager, även om jag nu har börjat tröttna lite på smaken, har konsumerat enorma mängder av den här lagern de senaste åren."
"Wygląd: lekko złocista, przejrzyste całkowicie, piana duża, wysoka, duże oczka (ale specjalnie tak nalałem), oblepia szkło.

"Color amarillo oscuro, cristalina. Espuma blanca media de retención decente. Aroma medio intenso a cereal y un toque herbal suave, como heno. Sabor a cereal, al principio dulzón, más tarde amargo aunque mínimo. Final seco muy agradable. Textura acuosa. Carbonatación media. Superrefrescante."
Pilsner ben fatta. Emerge il carattere industriale del prodotto ma rimane comunque bevibile e gradevole. Voto personale 7.5/10
"Barwa złota, klarowne, piana drobnopęcherzykowa, biała, na dwa palce, szybko się redukuje.W aromacie słód, chleb, trochę kwiatów. W smaku słodowe z solidną kontrą ziołowo-kwiatowej goryczki Goryczka średnia. Wysycenie powyżej średniego."
"barwa złota, idealnie klarowne, piana biała, średnioobfita, średnio-pęcherzykowa, dość szybko opada. pijalne, z dość zaznaczoną goryczką, wersja puszkowa jak najbardziej ok."
"Butelka, barwa złota, wysycenie średnie, obfita piana, która redukując się do opaski, zostawia koronkę na szkle. W aromacie i smaku słodowo, ale całkiem przyjemnie. Aromaty chmielowe w zasadzie niewyczuwalne. Natomiast goryczka została zaznaczona. Lekkie, przyzwoicie pijalne piwo."

"Robe blond doré, mousse blanche épaisse, nez herbeux typique du houblon, puis un côté céréale. En bouche, c'est le houblon qui domine, attaque amère, mais pas trop sèche. Le malt vient équilibrer en arrière bouche, avec un goût de pain. Longue amertume en bouche. Peut servir de « mètre-étalon » de la Pils."
"Carbonatación media, al igual que su cuerpo. Es una cerveza suave, con una pizca de amargor en su final muy agradable."

"Kolor złocisty, idealnie klarowne, puszysta śnieżnobiała piana. W aromacie słodowo-ziołowe, średnia intensywność. W smaku słodowe muśnięcie, jakaś tam metaliczność się pojawia, odrobina ziół, lekka goryczka na finiszu. Wysycenie średnie, ciało adekwatne do stylu. Szału nie ma, natomiast jest trochę lepsze od przeciętnego eurolagera."

"Klasyk wśród pilsnerów, więc trzeba było spróbować. Na początek zaskoczenie, bo aromat dość słaby, mało wyczuwalny. Ale już wygląd super, bardzo obfita piana, długo się utrzymuje, i idealny kolor. W smaku dość mocno goryczkowe, spore wysycenie, może ciut rozwodnione. Wyjątkowo pijalne i orzeźwiające. Goryczka w posmaku niezbyt zalegająca, plus trochę słodowości na końcu. Całkiem fajny, klasyczny pilsner. Jeśli ktoś lubi gatunek, to na pewno uzna go za bardzo dobry. Jeśli nie, to na pewno za przynajmniej solidny, tak jak ja.

"W smaku i aromacie nuty chlebowe, ziołowe, maślane, pełne, do tego nieco warzywek, goryczka ziołowo-łodygowa. Pijalność wysoka, gładkie smukłe. Z wyglądu złote z ładną, białą pianą. Ogólnie wszystko ok, tylko trochę ta łodyga na końcu przeszkadza"
Klasyka stylu. Średnia goryczka. W smaku czuć słodowość i delikatnie chmiel.

"A méltán híres Pilsner Urquell. Már jópárszor ittam ezt a sört. Szinte minden formában. Csapolva, dobozosan, palackozva. Leginkább persze csapolva nyújtja a legjobb formáját, de a dobozos verzió is okés, ha úgy jön ki a lépés. Most a 0,5 doboz verziót tesztelem. Illatában erőteljes fűszeres komló dominancia érezhető, ízében is a markáns keserűség. Utóíze száraz és hosszan tartó. Állítólag a szűretlen változata a legizgalmasabb, azt még nem volt lehetőségem megkóstolni. Mindegy, ami késik az múlik is."
"Barwa złota, klarowne, brzydka piana natychmiast opada. W aromacie masło, słód, ubogo i niezbyt przyjemnie. W smaku słodkie, słodowe Wysycenie średnie, goryczka średnia, bardzo wodniste. Kiepsko."
"Cóż można napisać o Pisnerze Urquell-u? Warto pić z puszki, żeby uniknąć skunksa (takiego tez oceniam), poza tym jest słodowo, z obowiązkową nutą diacetylu, goryczka jak na czeskiego pilsa, dość niska, porównując do koncerniaków, jest za to wyraźnie zaznaczona, zdecydowanie ziołowo-trawiasta, dość ciężka i zalegająca. Większych wad nie ma, choć pamiętam, że trafiałem sztuki z nutami mokrego kartonu. Piwo zdecydowanie wybitne nie jest, ale jako szeroko dostępne i do tego dość pijalne, na pewno jest dobrym wyborem na grilla w upalne dni."

"Pivo u flaši. Kažu da je to ""legendarno"" Češko pivo. Ne najbolje , nego pravi primjer ""tipičnog"" Češkog stila. Aroma je puna i sladno slatkasta. Tijelo je također solidne punoće. Okus je gorkast , ali tijelo to apsorbira svojom sladnom punoćom.

Классический пилзнер из Чехии не смог показать мне что то фантастическое. Легкий солодовый вкус и ничего более.
"Sattgelbe Farbe, blank. Viel, feinporiger, kräftiger Schaum. Kräftiges Hopenaroma, herber Geruch nach siliertem Heu. Süffig mit Hopfenaroma und Honignoten. Im Mund angenehm cremig, prickelnd. Ein rundes Bier, im Antrunk sehr vollmundig. 0,5l-Flasche am 26.1.18"
"7 mois avant DLC. Blonde, petit col de mousse à tenue moyenne. Sans carbo. Arôme bière industrielle avec houblonnage citronné (?). En bouche, maltée, mais bière industrielle standard."
"Butelka 06.08.18. Złote klarowne piana szybko się redukuje. W aromacie diacetyl, mokre zboże, lekki skunks. W smaku dużo lepiej wytrawne ale jednak słodkie, biszkoptowe, może trochę nawet karmelowe. Jest też ziołowy chmiel. Goryczka zaznaczona trochę długa ale bez przesady. Odczucie w ustach ok."
"Klare, goldgelbe Farbe mit mittelporiger, ansehnlicher Schaumkrone. Angenehm ausbalancierter malziger Geruch mit einer leichten Fruchtnote. Sehr süffig mit leichtem Körper und aktiver Kohlensäure, die Malzsüße ist wiederum gut ausbalanciert, bitterer Abgang. Angenehm unkompliziertes und leichtes Bier, dem dennoch genügend Aromen eigen sind."

"Idealnie klarowne, złociste, ładna pianka, musuje. Aromat słodowo-słodki z maślano-karmelowym diacetylem, lekka siarka. W smaku mocno chmielowo-goryczkowy (goryczka średnia do lekkiej), lekka podbudowa słodowa, może troszkę diacetylu, kapka żelaza. Fest pijalne i fajnie nagazowane, nie za mocno."
"ATTENZIONE:La mia valutazione viene fatta in base allo stile della birra.
Pilsner perfetta, poco corpo e forte presenza di luppolo ma niente di eccezionale. La birra ha un colore dorato con schiuma bianca ma non abbondante ma persistente. Il corpo è leggero e rinfrescante. Quello che domina la scena è il sapore del luppolo che è presente SEMPRE, cioè dall'inizio del sorso fino alla fine. Inoltre l'amaro rimane in bocca anche dopo alcuni secondi dopo il sorso. Quello che mi ha impressionato è…"
"Pity z tanku, że niby świeży... W aromacie nuty chmielowo-kwiatowe, przyprawowe, do tego chlebowy chmiel, tak jak ma być. W smaku wytrawne, lekko zbożowe o wyraźnie zarysowanej przyprawowej goryczce. Bardzo orzeźwiający, smaczny lager, co tu dużo gadać? 3.3 EDIT taki z flaszki ze sklepu to zwykły korpolager z plusem za wyższą goryczkę i podwyższony względem konkurentów aromat chmielowy."

Smak: słodowy, goryczka raczej niska, całkiem pijalne."
"Puszka. Wygląd - jasno złoty kolor, klarowne, z średnią pianą, ładnie zdobiącą szkło. Aromat - ładna chlebowa słodowość, jest trochę chmielowych aromatów, trochę kukurydzy i jogurtu, diacetyl. Jest ok. Smak - raczej słodkie, dużo słodowości i trochę kukurydzy, żatecki fajnie wyczuwalny, dalej w tle trochę jogurtu, goryczka niska, zaznaczona, całkiem przyjemna, dalej trochę diacetylu, nasycenie średnie, ciało dość lekkie."

Prezentuję się super bez zastrzeżeń. W smaku jest dobrze nie jest wodniste smak słodowy, fajna nie zalegająca długo goryczka.

"Piwo o jasnozłotej barwie, klarowne. Piana biała, zbudowana z małych i średnich pęcherzyków, dość obfita, długo utrzymująca się, zdobiąca szkło. W aromacie słód, chmiel i nuty ziołowe oraz zbożowe w tle może nieco kwiatowe. Smak słodowy, całkiem pełny, ziołowa goryczka na średnim poziomie świetnie wieńczy degustację. Nasycenie dość wysokie. Ikona stylu jak przystało bez wad/ Klasyczny Pilsner. Jednak jego walory najlepiej można docenić dopiero po  wcześniej jakiegoś typowego eurolagera."

Złocista barwa, dość trwała biała piana ładnie oblepiająca szkło. Aromat słodowy, jest chmiel i lekki diacetyl- generalnie to czym charakteryzuje się czeski pils. W smaku słodowość kontrowana ziołową goryczką (która mogłaby być jednak nieco wyższa). Gdzieś w tle przewijają się owocowe estry. Poprawny czeski pils. Tylko tyle i aż tyle."
"Barwa jasnozłota, piwo przejrzyste. Bardzo obfita, długo utrzymująca się piana pozostawiająca lacing na szkle. Aromat głównie słodowy, z początku pojawia się również chmiel ale z czasem ulatuje, lekko kwiatowy. Smak lekki, słodowy. Pojawia się ziołowa goryczka, nie za wysoka ale na pewno wyższa niż w przeciętnym jasnym lagerze. Piwo mocno nagazowane. Całkiem niezły pilsner, pijalny, lekki, bez większych wad"

W smaku słodowe, potem troche chmielu, pozostawia nieprzyjemny, jakby rozpuszczalnikowy posmak. Goryczka niska, ziołowa, wysycenie średnie, piwo wodniste. Da się wypić, ale wyznacznikiem styly bym go nie nazwał."

"Color dorado, translúcido, con capa de esuma blanca de dos dedos de grosor (no mucha retención). Carbonatación suave. Textura acuosa. Cereal, pan y lúpulo en nariz y boca, también toques de hierba húmeda. Seca de entrada. Amargor final suave. Postgusto seco decente."

Odczucie w ustach: lekkie, wysycenie wysokie, lekko sciagajace. 
Ogolnie: jak na piwo koncernowe to calkiem ok."
"Aromat delikatnie chmielowy - dosyć czysty. W smaku słodycz i słodowość przełamane delikatną, ziołową goryczką. Nieźle się prezentowało."
"Une pils très légère, assez neutre, tout à fait agréable. En plus elle est pas chère et facile à trouver!"
"Wyczuwalny aromat skunksa charakterystyczny dla piwa z zielonych butelek, poza tym słód oraz lekki chmiel. Wygląd - perfekcyjnie klarowne, złote, nie mam nic do zarzucenia. W smaku słód, chmiel, wyczuwalny diacetyl. Goryczka średnia w kierunku niskiej, cierpka, ziołowa. Wysycenie średnie, goryczka zalega w bardzo małym stopniu, nie jest wodniste - ma jakieś ciało. Trochę lepiej niż przeciętny koncerniak ale do Pierwszej Pomocy czy chociażby Warmińskich Rewolucji nie ma podejścia."
"Złote, obfita piana, trochę szybko się dziurawi i opada; klarowne. Na początku ładny chmielowy aromat, po chwili jednak robi się nijaki. W smaku nie jest źle, jest goryczka, minimalnie lepiej niż koncernowy lager Może to przez nalewanie, ale niskie nasycenie."

"Colore dorato. Schiuma fresca ecompatta.
All’olfatto sentore di fiorito e vegetale che richiama il luppollo Saaz coltivato nella zona. Al palato è fresca perfettamente bilanciato dall’amaro del luppolo. Perfetta con un aperitivo o con cene a base di pescesi sposa bene con piatti delicati a base di pesce. Una buona birra."

"Cerveza correcta. Creo que cada vez es más difícil que una cerveza tipo Lager llegue a llamarme demasiado la atención. Me gustan, pero nada que ver con las de alta fermentación. De esta cerveza diré que tiene más aroma que muchas pilsner, una apariencia ambarina, sabor y cuerpo suaves y paladar correcto."

Equilibrada e refrescante, um clássico."

"De un dorado tan brillante y limpio que casi hay que ponerse gafas de sol.
Espuma poco consistente y pequeñísima burbuja.
Aroma muy lineal a cebada y alguna leve nota herbal. En boca está bien estructurada, con el lúpulo muy presente, dominándolo todo y otorgándole un delicado amargor."
La única Pilsener que me ha gustado hasta el momento. Muy sabrosa. Gran historia. Gran Cerveza.

"Aromat czeskiego pilsa czyli lekki diacetyl, delikatnie majaczy chmiel, mało intensywny, jednak przyjemny. Barwa jasnozłota, piana początkowo obfita, jednak szybko opadająca. W smaku wytrawne, dosyć wodniste, czuć nuty słodowe. Goryczka niska do średniej, wysycenie wysokie. Bardzo klasyczny czeski pils, przez to bez fajerwerków, ale trzyma poziom."

"W aromacie mokra szyszka chmielu z lekkim diacetylem i słodowym zacięciem. Piwo barwy złotej, z ładną białą czapą piany. Drobiniki dwutlenku węgla buzują w szkle. Słodowo - ziołowe, lekkie i orzeźwiające. Pije się naprawdę świetnie, lecz przydałaby się goryczka trochę wyższa i byłoby naprawdę okej. Ogólnie na plus."

"Barwa złota, klarowne, piana biała, dość obfita, dość szybko zanika. W aromacie słodowość, nuty ziołowe, chmielowe, minimalny diacetyl. W smaku słodowe, zbożowe, ze średniej mocy goryczką, dość przyjemną, ziołowo-trawiastą. Wysycenie wysokie, treściwość średnia, dobra pijalność.

"W zapachu ze szkła ziołowy chmiel, charakterystyczny słód pilzneński i lekki diacetyl. Nalewa się z bardzo wysoką, białą średniopęcherzykową pianą, która dosyć szybko opada. Piwo w barwie jest jasnozłote, całkowicie klarowne. W aromacie ze szkła więcej chmielu niż z butelki - jest ziołowo-trawiasty, przyjemny. Słodowość kojarzy się tutaj ze zbożem czy nawet kukurydzą. Diacetyl w typowo maślanym stylu cały czas utrzymuje się w tle - nie ma tu na tyle intensywnych aromatów by miał się za czym schować.

"Pilsner Urquell od dawna nie gościł moim szkle. Zapamiętałem jednak to piwo jako wyróżniające się spośród propozycji browarów polskich sprzed jakichś 10-15 lat. Dla mnie, przede wszystkim wyróżniał się sporą (tak mi się wtedy wydawało) goryczką. Od tamtego czasu wypiłem sporo piw, ale pewien jestem (co do Pilsnera) jednego - goryczka była! Nie wiem, co się przez ten czas z owym piwem działo, ale wśród nut słodowych, lekkiej metaliczności i mokrego kartonu, goryczki nie uświadczyłem. Również aromat był płaski i jednolity - słód i mokry karton. Nawet wizualnie nie było…"
"Bottiglia, 33 cl. Bellissimo colore giallo dorato e schiuma leggera. Al naso malto e luppolo. Corpo leggero, carbonazione media. Aroma di malto è luppolo ben presente."
"Jakkolwiek nowofalowe piwa z upływem czasu zrobiły ze mnie napuszonego piwnego lorda, w przypadku Pilsnera nie mogę ocenić niżej. Wychowałem się na tym piwie i dopóki z 5-6 lat temu nie spróbowałem angielskich ejlów z Carrefoura, Pilsner Urquell był dla mnie piwem numer jeden. Może jakaś tam Czerna Hora czy Bernard orbitowały wokól tego pierwszego miejsca. Dla mnie wciąż klasyka."
"16.08.16 Data ważności, kupiony oczywiście w biedronce. Piana w miarę niska, znika dosyć szybko po nalaniu. Piękny, złocisty i klarowny kolor (może nawet bursztynowy). Jest dobry lacing. W zapachu słód, lekko wyczuwalny zapach chmielu. W smaku głównie chmielowy i gorzki, nie wyłania się nic więcej. Na podniebieniu zostaje lekka goryczka, ale nie jest ona zbyt wysoka - pozwala się cieszyć na spokojnie kolejnym łykiem piwa. Ot, typowy czeski pilsner. Pozycja obowiązkowa, nawet dla osób mieszkających z dala od wszelkich sklepów piwnych."
Buona pils molto fresca da 33cl alla spina migliora molto beverina e commerciale.

Smak to wyraźny słód, także występuje nuta chlebowo miodowa, goryczka średnia do niskiej. Piwo troszkę zbyt mocno wysycone i goryczka zalega. Ogólnie piwo jest utlenione, w smaku poza zalegającą goryczką nic nie oferuje. Chciałbym kiedyś spróbować tego piwa z beczki, na pewno byłoby o niebo lepiej."
"Flaska från SB. Klar gyllengul färg med vit skumkrona. Frisk brödig doft. Smak av bröd, äpple och pilsnermalt. En fräsch pilsner helt enkelt."
"Aromat słodowy, ale i z nutami świeżego chmielu, lekko ziołowy, trawiasty. Barwa ciemnozłota, klarowne. Piana drobna, wysoka, ale krótka. W smaku miodowe, ziołowe, dosyć pełne, za mocno nagazowane. Niezła goryczka."
"WYGLĄD: Barwa żółta, klarowne. Piana drobno i średnio pęcherzykowa, szybko opada, oblepia szkło.
AROMAT: W aromacie głównie słodowość i diacetyl, nuty ziołowo-trawiaste, gdzieś tak hen daleko czeski chmiel się pojawia.
SMAK: Masło, miód i goryczka, czyli zabójcza mieszanka. Do tego piwo jest słodkie,…"
"Tak klasyka absolutna, jak to oceniać. W zapachu słodowy, lekko chlebowy, z lekko ziołową nutą chmielową i delikatnym diacetylem w tle.

W smaku jest słodowość, chlebowość, odrobina masła i spora ziołowa goryczka, lekko zalegająca.…"

"Cor amarelo intenso com espuma branca e persistente.
Aroma forte de lúpulo, floral, um pouco citrico e herbal.
Sabor de lúpulo com amargor bem pronunciado, lembrando uma IPA, mas com o corpo mais leve de uma lager."
"Das Original wird seinem Namen gerecht. Ein Pilsner wie es sein muss, nicht süss, nicht zu herb."
"0,5 boks fra Netto Nørrebro, på hytta: klar gylden med fint skum. Blomsteraktig aroma, nesten sommerlig. Flott humlebitt i smaken, som er kompleks, kraftig og samtidig elegant. En pilsner med personlighet."
Legítima Pilsen da República tcheca. Avermelhada e muito amarga. Não aguarda meu paladar. Mas com o tempo pode ser reversível.
"Kolor jasnego bursztynu. Piana pokaźna o małych bombelkach, średnio schodzi, zostawia fajne ślady na kuflu. Zapach owocowy, smak przyjemny, owocowy - czuć nuty cytrusowe. Mało gazowane, słaba goryczka.
Bardzo przyjemne piwo do meczu ale nie tylko. Relacja cena do jakości bardzo poprawna."

"Faktycznie, jako wzór i oryginał piw typu pilzner wypada znakomicie. Mimo wszystko to wciąż tylko i wyłącznie pilzner ;) Uwaga na zieloną butelkę - trzymana na świetle powoduje bardzo szybko zmianę aromatu i smaku piwa."
"La pilsner ceca per eccellenza. Prodotta ancora utilizzando buoni malti e luppoli abbastanza carichi di amaro, è molto beverina e piacevole"
"Une très bonne pils aux malts grillés, aux houblons herbacés et floraux, rafraîchissante, généreuse et finement amère."
"Brilhante, espuma densa, aroma de lúpulo herbal e leve frutado. Amargor médio, leve acidez."
"Po przelaniu do szklanki Pilsner Urquell łapie u mnie pianowego minusa, bo niby obfita, ale bardzo szybko się redukuje do obwódki. Barwa dobra - klarowne, jasne złoto. W aromacie na szczęście jest już dobrze – charakterystyczny pilsnerowy zapach chmielu (ziołowy, korzenny) w połączeniu ze słodami, czyli bardzo dobry aromat „normalnego piwa”. Następnie pierwszy łyk – początek słodki z mocną goryczkową kontrą, która jest krótka, orzeźwiająca i przyjemna."
"Najlepsze czeskie piwo jakie do tej pory piłem :)
The best czech beer I have ever drunk :)"

Piana: Bardzo obfita, dość trwała, drobno- i śreniopęcherzykowa.…"
Dit is een lekker dorstlessende pils met een bitter die lang op de tong blijft. Geniet er van languit op je chaise longue op je dakterras terwijl je door de nieuwe Libelle bladert. Vergeet niet de boel de boel te laten. Tis tenslotte genieten!
"Bardzo dobry czeski pilzner, super goryczka, piana, wysycenie, itd. Ogólnie czeskie piwa to potęga światowa."
33cl @ bottiglia (supermarket). Onestamente non vedo differenza fra questa birra e le classiche industriali da supermercato. Non mi piace.

"Botella 33cl. De color dorado y con buena espuma. Muy buena compensación de sabores, con predominio de la malta y toques ligeros a madera que quedan muy compensados. Una muy buena pilsen que me ha sorprendido gratamente."
"Nem hiába az eredeti pilzneri sör. Egyedül a habjával nem vagyok kibékülve, illetve üvegben kicsit szénsavas. De az íze egészen kiváló, a színétől pedig libabőrös leszek."
"Talvez uma das melhores pilsen que já provei, a pesar de não ser meu estilo preferido. Bem malteada e com lupulacao equilibrada. Não fosse o preço daria pra ser a cerveja do churrasco.

"Aromája már abban a pillanatban érzékelhető ennek a gyönyörűen tiszta, aranyszínű sörnek, amikor a kupak még épp csak megmozdul az üveg nyakán a felnyitás előtt: már ekkor árasztja magából azt az erőteljes komlós illatot, mely idővel maga mellé enged egy kevés élesztősséget is, így kölcsönözve egy tökéletesen telt jelleget a sörnek. Íze nemkülönben kifinomult: nagyszerűen vegyíti a lágy, édeskés és élesztős zamatokat a komló határozott karakterével, mely utóbbi hosszan tartó utóízt hagy maga után, elnyújtva ezzel az ízlelés folyamatát.

"Buona pilsner industriale. Bionda con schiuma bianca. Al naso un leggero sentore di malto. In bocca molto dissetante ma priva di sostanza. Frizzantezza giusta e corpo leggero. Bilanciata lievemente verso l’amaro. Forse questa sia una delle migliori lager pasteurizzate da supermercato. Comunque dopo assaggiare pilsner artigianali crude, questi prodotti non hanno più senso nei nostri giorni. Quindi non la posso consigliare anche se è una birra con tanta storia."

Bouquet de houblon et de caramel. Un peu amère, très douce. Léger goût de céréales grillées et de caramel. Bien équilibrée malgré le faible ABV. Goût satisfaisant, goûte vraiment la bière."
"Világos sörökben nálam ez nagyon viszi a pálmát. Ugyan kevés világosat szeretek, inkább fekete és barna sör párti lennék. A boltban, sok helyen is kapható, nagyon kellemes, lágy utóízzel rendelkezik. Keserű, de nem epekeserű íze vanm jó aromája és egész karakteres az illata. Ráadásul pénztárcabarát sör."
Klassisk god öl som är väldigt frisk och törstsläckande. Fungerar bra till grillat och annat.

"Mocno słodowy w zapachu. Można wyczuć nuty chmielowe, ale raczej ulotne. Piana trzyma się dzielnie do końca pozostawiając kołderkę. Raczej wytrawny niż słodki w smaku. Lekko ściągająca gorycz."
En öl som är ett måste som en av de klassiska ölen. Lättdrucken och balanserad. Men har den inte blivit lite tunnare med åren?
"Still one of the greatest ! A real classic !Da können noch so viel Pisener auf den Markt kommen, das Urquell ist wie ein Fels in der Branndung."
"Jaune très limpide, assez claire. Des odeurs de céréales fraîches et de minéraux surgissent. En bouche, une amertume parfaitement dosée (lamertume idéale entre le trop peu et l’insoutenable) s’impose. L’arrière goût est entièrement en amertume (fine et sèche). Un classique désormais difficile à trouver au Québec (2014). Ça m’irrite un peu de ne pas trouver de Pilsner Urquell alors que je peux me procurer de la Beck’s de la Heineken, de la Stella Artois, de la Carlsberg et plusieurs autres produits qui ne trouvent leur prestige que dans le seul fait d’être importés."
"Pils tchèque ""authentique"". Couleur dorée, brillante, pétillante. Belle mousse, blanche, aux pores larges qui retombe rapidement. De corps léger à moyen, cette bière au goût amer en entrée-issu du houblon-évolue rapidement vers des notes d’abord crèmeuses puis plus douces.

Belle blonde de soif. Aucun signe remarquable mais un bon équilibre et une belle longueur pour cette bière basique.

Au nez elle sent surtout le malt mais en bouche explosion d’amertume elle est longue et parfaite en bouche, la bière de soif par excellence !"

Ho provato a mettermi nell’ottica di un appassionato di pilsner ma non ce l’ho fatta. non è proprio il mio genere, Il profumo è luppolato, con lievi sentori di cereali.  la schiuma è ampia, abbastanza persistente. Il corpo è quasi nullo, scorre davvero come acqua naturale. Il gusto ricorda un po’ i biscotti al riso ed il luppolo è di tipo erbaceo.
Non mi piace ma non nego che sia comunque caratteristica rispetto alle solite lager…"
Pils de couleur blond dorÃ©. De fort arÃ´mes de houblon se dÃ©gagent. Ensuite des pointes de miel et de citron. Attaque franche mais le sucre apporte un Ã©quilibre Ã©tonnant sur l’amertume. Un final herbeux et enveloppant. AgrÃ©able.

"La reine de toutes les pilsener, elle débute pourtant un peu mal : très pâle, extrêmement mince, elle dégage des odeurs (contenues) de moufette.

Meilleure en certaines circonstances il est vrai, mais néanmoins un grand plaisir à boire."

alla spina un po migliore l’amaro è molto ma si sente molto nel finale le unitàa di amaro si nascondono bene ilò malto bilancia abbastanza la birra"
"Pressão. Coloração dourada, creme branco razoável. Presença equilibrada de malte e lúpulo. Corpo leve. Final amargo talvez excessivo."
esta la probe en todos lados y todos los dias despues de reuniones nos echabamos las birrias y pasamos un buen rato que vale la pena bien rica
"Boa Pilsen. A lendária - talves tenha influenciado minhas avaliações. Coloração amarelo ouro, com espuma branca sempre presente. Aroma fraco de cereais maltados, com suave tom adocicado. Sabor complexo, com forte amarguês - lúpulo sempre presente. Densa, com presença do malte, o que remete a paes e tons frutosos. Boa drincabilidade. Não foi minha melhor pilsen."
"En fût. Pinte dégustée chez Belze Pub (Prague, Rép. Tchèque). Arôme: Odeur d’houblon avec une pointe de caramel. Apparence: La couleur est blonde orangée. Présence d’un moyen col mousseux et d’une fine dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Goût d’houblon herbacé avec une pointe fruitée. Durée moyenne de l’arrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture huileuse. Faible effervescence en bouche. Arrière goût légèrement houblonné. (Rating #1541)"
"Bardzo dobre, ogolnie dostepne w Polsce. Ladna butelka, fajnie smakuje i jestem bardzo za.."
"Egy igazi típus teremtő sör,minden pilsner ős atyja.Ez a kesernyés finomság minden ilyen sörnek az alapja.Igazi társasági sör,egyik nagy kedvencem!Csapolva az igazi!"
"Flaske. uigennemsigtig gylden, med en god sød maltbase. Ingen udpræget humlebitterhed hvilket gør denne pilsner mindre frisk, men stadig lækker."
"Da quel che mi aspettavo è stata un po’ una delusione, ma forse avrei dovuto prevederlo; l’amaro c’è, piuttosto potente, è abbastanza duraturo nel retrogusto (che direi il punto forte di questa birra), ma per il resto l’esperienza degustativa non ha particolari picchi, soprattutto non al naso. Sarà che lo stile non mi entusiasma, ma credevo meglio. Comunque più che bevibile e simpatica, sicuramente una delle migliori scelte ""da bar"" nel suo genere."
"Cannette. De couleur dorée et transparente. Nez de grains de malt pâle, de houblon herbeux (foin) et légèrement floral, léger de pain et avec des notes fruitées (agrumes et zest). Moyennement ronde en bouche avec un pétillement moyen et croustillant ainsi qu’une texture légèrement crémeuse. Goût de grains de malt pâle avec de petites notes fruitées (zest d’agrumes, notes de pommes vertes) lors de l’entrée en bouche suivi d’un goût malté légèrement sucré rappelant un goût de biscuits et avec un léger goût de pain et de faibles traces de miel parallèlement à un goût…"
"Lys gullig øl fået på ferie i Prag.

Samgen er meget som en tuborg, dog mere humlet."
"Comme je me suis promi, version cannette de 500 ml. Couleur doré mi-foncé, petit collet. Arome faible d’houblon et un peu d’herbe. Goût d’houblon simplistique et rien de plus. Buvable mais c’est tout."
"Green bottle of 330 ml, Color yellow-gold. Smell of hops, Taste of hops with little bitterness for finale, A refreshing beer.

"Aussi légendaire qu’elle puisse m’apparaitre, le party bucal n’est point au rendez-vous.  Sa vigueur et sa jeunesse au gout surprend et donne l’envie de boire une autre gorgé. L’essayer c’est l’adopter!"
"can.  corn and hops aroma.  Clear golden color with bubbles and light white head thats goes off quickly.  Taste is  lightly fruity and hops.  Good Pilsner, nothing to do with bud and ...

Not a bad beer. Pours golden color. Skunky smell. Very refreshing. Vaut la peine d’être essayé.
"Une bonne blonde.  C’est rare que j’aime une blonde, mais elle a un goût plus prononcée que d’autres.  Pas d’arrière goût, c’est bon."
"Canette de la LCBO. Robe blonde très claire. Malt présent. Légèrement caramélisée. Houblon amérisant en arrière-goût, mais sans finesse."
"Bue en canette.Il y a un tres grande difference avec celle en bouteille.Beaucoup plus malte.
Je ne suis pas un amteurs du style mais jaime bien."
"Tipica cerveza checa, aunq prefiero la Bud checa. Es la decana del pisen. Muy buena cerveza para los amantes de este tipo."
